generally speaking what type of movies do you watch
i like thrillers a lot.
thrillers? for example?
zodiac's one of my favorite movies.
zodiac the movie about a serial killer from the '60s or '70s, around there.
zodiac? oh wow ok, what do you like about that movie
and i just think serial killers, in general, are interesting, so the movie was really good. and it was just neat to see that world. like it went really in-depth. it was like almost 3 hours long, so you got to really feel like you were a part of that world and time period. and see what the detectives and the police did and the investigators.
so you feel like you were part of that world ?
yeah. it was really an immersive movie.
if you were in the movie what character do you feel most relatable
probably the main character, robert graysmith, just cuz he's awkward and bumbly. so, i guess that's the one i would be the closest to.
what scene do you like the best
probably the most memorable one is the murder at the lake. just cuz it's really vivid and horrific to watch. but it's very memorable.
ok nice, any other similiar movies you have seen recently?
not that i can think of.
how about different type of movies like once upon a deadpool
i haven't seen that.
have you heard of that movie
i've heard of it, but i haven't seen it.
would you be interested to watch it
not particularly. i don't really like comic book movies that much. but i really wanted to see deadpool, so i'd probably be more willing to watch that than most comic book movies.
oh what makes deadpool different than the others?
i don't know. it just seems a unique concept and different, not just the standard superhero movie.
and it's more of a comedy, so that's unique.
ok so you enjoy comedy as well, correct?
yep, i think most people do.
what type of movie you don't enjoy?
i'm not a big action movie fan like die hard or like rambo movies. i don't hate them, i just think they're boring. like i can't watch a lot of them, or else i get sick of them.
what about mission impossible?
never seen it. i know what it is, but i haven't seen it.
do you care who acts in the movie?
just in general? i'm not i'm not picky about actors. like i won't see a movie just cuz i don't like the actor in it.
oh ok so you dont have a favorite actor is that right
i mean i like certain actors more than others, but i wouldn't say i have a favorite actor.
ok who came to your mind when it comes to actors you like to see in the movie
what is your favorite tom hanks movie?
catch me if you can
what so great about that movie
it's just an interesting story and it's based on a true story and it's got leonardo dicaprio in it, another good actor.
do you think that movie is exciting?
yep.
which scene you find most memorable?
it's been a long time since i've seen that movie. i can't think of any specific scene.
what kind of movies do you generally like?
yeah, i mostly like comedy movies.
i see. why do you like that kind of movie?
well i like that kind of movie because you know, it'll make me laugh, and i often watch movies with my girlfriend, and i want to make sure whatever we watch, it's something we can both enjoy and and relax while watching.
that seems really nice. can you think of a movie you really enjoyed recently?
yeah, i really enjoyed the longest yard with adam sandler.
what did you like about that movie?
i liked the acting. it's a lot of humor and gags in the movie. it had a good pace, good pacing. the story made sense.
yeah, very funny movie.
i see. that's really helpful.
oh great.
now i'd like to know what kinds of movies you dislike if that's okay?
yeah, sure.
good question. not really a fan of hallmark movies, that kind of romantic comedy. mostly because they typically have pretty bad acting. yeah, not for me.
why else don't you like those?
well, i guess another reason would be that the stories are all typically same or very similar. there's no
it's just it's just very boiler plate. there's nothing there's not much new about each new hallmark movie.
i see. they're pretty cookie-cutter it sounds like
that's exactly right.
so based on what you told me, i'm curious, did you see jurassic world?
i have not seen jurassic world, no.
but i saw the original jurassic park
what did you think of the original?
i liked the original a lot. very creative movie. very ahead of it's time with the computer generated imagery cgi.
yeah, it is it still holds up. it's still is a great movie even compared to anything that that's coming out today.
that's great. so if you liked the original would you consider seeing jurassic world given the option to?
yeah, i would i would certainly consider it, yes.
i don't know too much about it, but i i think i saw the commercial for it.
what kinds of movies do you like?
i really like comedy movies.
why do you like comedies?
i love to laugh and comedy movies, that's their whole purpose. make you laugh.

hello. what kind of movies do you like?
hello. i like horror movies.
can you give two reasons why you like horror movies
i like to feel that inside of you that scares you to death, but you still want to continue watching the movie. i like when i feel goosies all over my arms, you know? that's the reason why i like it.
can you name a particular movie that you like?
saw
what are the 2 reasons you like saw?
because it was sad, it was a horror movie and it was like playing a game, you want to play a game with me and they will catch people and put them in a home let's say in a house and they will lock them and they need to find the way to leave. but in order to leave a place they will have to end up dead.
can you name a movie that you do not like?
but i do like all the movies.
surely, there must be one movie you can't stand or thought was poorly done
let me think.
well, i don't know. emily rose, maybe. emily rose.
what are the 2 things that you dislike about this movie?
it was fake. you could tell that it was poorly made, and i didn't get scared at all.
do you like the movie aliens?
i have not watched that movie.
what about hunger games?
i have not watched that movie, either.
how about the matrix?
i did watch it.
how did you feel about it?
kind of cool, but not my cup of tea.
what 2 things were kinda cool about it?
do you like the movie dunkirk?
i have not watched that movie.
how about wonder woman?
oh yeah. i watched that movie.
how did you feel about it?
i loved it because it was a woman, the powerful one in the movie, finally. and it's always just the guy doing everything, you know what i'm saying?

she was very beautiful, her hair was amazing.

the way she will fight it was interesting.

i am drawn to romances.
have you seen fifty shade of grey?
i have not.
i know of it very well, but i have not seen it.
what was a movie that you last watched that surprised you?
maybe white house down was surprising for me.
what made you like the movie?
i didn't go into it with high expectations at all. i thought it was just going to be i don't know, a lot of blowing up, pretty dumb, but was it it was i think when i watched it, it was summer day or summer night where almost nothing seemed to be on cable, and i was just looking for something to watch, and i thought, oh, okay, it stars channing tatum. i'll watch that. or i'll turn to that. i probably won't be there for too long. it ended up being a ton of fun.
it was like a new version of die hard. they had a lot of fun with the movie. and despite it being like unrealistic and they're blowing things up, it was great. it was just a really fun hour and a half.
have you seen dawn of the planet of the apes?
no.
have you seen avatar?
yeah.
what didnt you like about that movie?
you know, epics like that are a hard sell for me. it's very long. i wasn't nearly as charmed by the blue people that they were that most other people were. i don't know. it seemed to be lacking in finesse and it just seemed very over the top. it really did seem like an event movie, and maybe if i had seen it in the theater, i would have sort of fallen in love with it like other people did, but
it just it was underwhelming. the direction wasn't nearly as good as i thought it was going to be and i just thought it was going to be something more exciting and more appealing that it ended up being for me.
have you seen john wick?
no, but i know i know what that movie is, yeah.
have you seen halloween?
i mean, sure.
what do you like about the halloween movies?
i don't like the halloween movies. i don't like scary movies. so, when i watched that that was just like at a party with friends. and that's what they wanted to watch. i just don't enjoy scaring myself like that. so, the first halloween the one that originally has jamie curtis from back in the day, that is a much better movie than the other halloweens were. but, i still they are still not my favorite. too scary.
and outside of the first one. and apparently i ha i haven't seen up the most recent one that is sort of a direct sequel to the first one. those that is a lot of gore, a lot of blood, a lot of trying to scare and not a lot of story line in movie.

if have seen them, it's usually been not in the theaters, on dvds.
i just don't really enjoy them.
is it because the plot isn't that good?
a lot of times, plus a lot of it's already been done. a lot of it's just rehashing stuff that's been done. you know, it's like movie number eight or movie number nine or something you know, something crazy. i don't know. i mean, i've seen some of the early ones.

thank you.
what kind of movies do u like
i really like movies in a science fiction setting. or fantasy are my favorites.
can u name a particular movie that fits that category that you liked, and some qualities about it that you liked
the matrix, for one, has a bit of action but in a futuristic-type setting.
and with well-developed characters.
thanks for describing that. and could u tell me about a movie that fits that category but you didn't like
let me think.
i would say the first alien.
what didn't you like about it
the pacing was slow. they try to make it into a horror flack instead of a syfy flaking.
the robotics and stuff weren't that good in my opinion.
i think its an overrated movie.
thanks for sharing. have you seen guardian of the galaxy?
the first one, yes.
do you like movies like the hunger games?
i do. i do like the hunger games.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you like?
it's complex but it's very well done.
can you say a little more about that please?
sure. it's not a simple movie. you've to pay attention in order to follow what's going on but movies like the hunger games it's very it's done very well. it's a high quality movie so it really pulls off transferring what's in the book on to screen.
do you like movies like good will hunting?
i love good will hunting.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you like?
well, the acting is fantastic like bow down fantastic across the board. and it's a touching story, it has some sort of sort of like a coming of age feel to it in some ways, very original, but also it has it's very serious. many times it's it has a true impact on the characters lives, but definitely plenty of moments to laugh and laugh at it even though it's more
so plenty of moments to sort of enjoy what's going on and not just have it be a serious tale of a transformation of a character.
can you say a little more about that please?
sure like there's like famous lines from the movie and most of those famous lines they're comedic lines. like how about them apples, and you know i went to go see you know he stole my line, i went to go see about a girl those are the lighter moments of the film. they don't really have much to do with truly really what happens in the film, but they're memorable and they're really fun parts of the film that were made the balance of the film
do you like movies like the help?
not really.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you dislike?
well, the acting is very good, but for me,
i have very little interest about the sort of white people writing about you know, black people who you know, uplifting stories and you know, oh how we helped the how oh us you know, do-gooding white people helped these small black people succeed, and that kind of thing. not my thing at all. definitely not something i think do i need to be sitting around for 2 hours watching.
can you say a little more about that please?
sure i'm black.
i don't need to sit through a movie explaining how white people help black people get out of poverty or servant roles or anything like that. i don't need to watch the help. my great-grandparents lived the help. i don't need to watch a movie by white people about the help.
thank you for your most insightful critique. have a nice weekend.

avatar and
seeking a friend for the end of the world had to be my two favorite movies.
why is avatar one of your favorite movies?
what about you?
my favorite movie is a walk to remember
what is that movie about?
it's about a delinquent boy who falls in love with a good girl
that sounds pretty cute, especially if he actually turns good for her for her falling for him, and then he just stays the same.
yeah, it was a good movie, a classic
what year was that movie made?
2002
do you know the average rating of that movie?
7.4/10
i actually may watch that myself.
what type of movies do you not like?
ah.
the movies i usually don't like have to be the movies that end and don't have a point.
or they or it felt like it ended too early. there are some movies that try to be artsy and they're pointless, but they're not funny pointless like seinfeld. they're just pointless, and they're trying to take snippets of life, and it feels like it's just wasting my time or it did waste 2 hours of my time.
i see. do you like movies like bridesmaids?
i actually never heard of bridesmaids, could you tell me about it?
sure
are you going to tell me anything about it?
annie is a single woman whose own life is a mess, but when she learns that her lifelong best friend, lillian (), is engaged, she has no choice but to serve as the maid of honor.
that sounds like a new like a movie for middle-aged women.
okay. thank you
talk to you next time
what kind of movies do you enjoy?
i like most movies, but i really like movies that are based on true stories.
is there a specific reason why?
i think it's just easier to get invested in the story when you know it's at least partially true, whereas if it's all fiction like i like fiction movies, but if they're true, it's easier to believe it cuz it actually happened.
i can definitely understand that
is there a specific movie that you enjoy?
i really like zodiac. that's one of my favorite movie.
that was a great movie, what did you enjoy about it?
i just really like true crime, and it's a really good movie. it's probably the best true crime movie i've ever seen, and it's just really interesting, and jake gyllenhaal's really a good actor in it.
a lot of people do enjoy his acting. are there any types of movies that you dislike?
i don't really like romantic comedies that much.
is there a reason why?
i just think they all feel the same, like they're all very cliched.
i see, you feel like they all follow the same formula. is there a specific movie that you don't enjoy?
yep.
probably the worst movie i've ever seen was the adventures of pluto nash. i don't think there's any movie that's worse than that.
that is a pretty bad movie and a lot of people mutually agree on that. is there one big reason why you don't enjoy it?
i mean it's not a funny movie. meant to be a comedy, but i saw it when i was like 10. i didn't laugh once. if you can't make a 10-year-old laugh, then you got problem.
that is funny, and i can agree with that. have you seen the movie tag?
nope. i have not.
how about a star is born?
no. i haven't that either.
john wick 2?
nope, haven't seen it.
what type of movies do you enjoy?
comedy movies
what appeals to you with these type of movies?
well, they don't have to have a sensible plotline usually, and they make me laugh.
is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
[inaudible]
what did you like about this movie?
i just thought it was funny overall.
are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?
i don't like drama.
what about these movies is unappealing?
well, i have enough drama in my life as it is, and i just don't like the thought of thinking about other people's problems. not superficial, you know, the cliche problems in drama
is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?
i can't think of any at the moment.
have you seen stepbrothers
yes.
what did you enjoy or not enjoy about this movie?
i thought the lead actors, will ferrell and i don't know what the other guy's name is i think that they are a good combination. so, i liked just because of that.
thank you for your help and have a wonderful day!
what type of movies do you enjoy?
i enjoy all kinds, but i really like you know, superhero movies, action movies, stuff like that.
what do you enjoy about them?
the action and the characters, you know, civil era movies is kind self explanatory, but i kind of like the villains too sometimes especially if it's a good actor play and a good villain and, you know, just like regular action movies. if there's a good character if it's fun, you know, not somebody that just kills a lot of people, but somebody that, you know, is fun to watch kind of like bruce willis
the die hard movies or stallone in pretty much anything, action movie he's been in, or schwarzenegger, you know, with the quippy phrases, like in terminator.
i can definitely see the appeal in that
what specific movie from that genre do you enjoy?
well, i like the new the marvel movies are really good probably the best of the superhero ones at least so far. just regular action movies i kind of like i kind of like the old ones the fun ones with schwarzenegger and, you know, like the terminator movies and the rambo movies were all good. the older ones not the not the last one and they got one kind of out soon. i don't know what it'll be
you know i just this kinds of movies.
what did you like about those movies?
well, you didn't have to really think about what was going on. it was usually you know, i mean, they're all kind of the same plot, except for the superhero movies. but the action movies, they're all kind of the same plot. it's like you know, some kind of crazy thing happens, and then they have to go on a rampage and kill a bunch of people. the superhero movies though, i like those because the plots are so intricate nowadays. it's not like you know, like the early superman movies
were kind of fluff and stuff and now the the newer ones have complicated story lines and complicated characters.
it does seem like those movies have evolved
are there any type of movies that you dislike?
i'm not a real big fan of horror movies.
i just not because they're scary or anything, just because they're just not i don't know. they just don't really appeal to me. like i guess the last good one i saw was probably the first ring, maybe. but nowadays they're just so cookie cutter and
kind of blah. if if you know, if there was a really good smart one that came out, i'd probably watch it, but i generally just avoid car movies altogether cuz they're just too it's like watching the same movie over and over again.
a lot of people feel the same way and think they lack substance
is there a particular movie that you dislike?
nothing in particular. i just like i said i don't i don't generally watch a lot of i can't think of a really bad movie i have seen lately. i must have seen good ones.
but i can't think of a really bad movie that i've seen.
is that i don't watch but i try to watch try to make sure the movies are good before i can see them.
have you seen ant man?
yeah, i saw that. it was it was pretty good. it was better than the first one, i thought.
but you know, it's it's it's not as good as some of the other marvel movies. but it was fun. i like
what did you like or dislike about it?
i liked it was it was kind of smart. it was
it was a little better than the first one. i don't know, it was fun to watch, but
i mean really not like anything about it. it's just it's just not quite as a compelling he's not quite as a compelling character as some of the other marvel superheroes.
i can definitely understand that, thanks for your feedback!

i like watching entertaining movies, mostly animation movies.
can u name a movie that fits that category that you thoroughly enjoyed?
yes, recently i watched, well, last year a movie called your name which was a movie with a great plot that was very interesting.
what qualities about your name did u enjoy? besides the plot
the the depiction of characters and how the director played with different timelines in one movie. kinda don't want to if you've never seen it spoiler, but the way that you walk up to the climax at the end was masterfully done.
thanks for describing that for me. is there a movie that fits the category you mentioned that you didn't enjoy
a lot of people like this movie, but i really hated it. space jam, it was a mixture of animation and basketball.
what about it did u hate?
i just i just thought the story was really weird. like i said, a lot of people love it. i'm just not one of them.
was it just the mix of animation and real life that u didn't like?
the plot was also weird. like, it doesn't have to be super realist, but it has to make sense and in my mind it was kind of cobbled together. it wasn't really a good movie.

i have not.

what is one of your favorite movies?
one of my favorite movies that comes to mind is actually kind of a romantic comedy and that's you've got mail. it's a super old movie, but i still really like it.
what do you like about it?
it's funny, and it's kind of dated now. but it's funny, and it's well-written. and i'm a fan tom hanks, especially when he was young. so, that's one of my favorite movies of his, as cheesy as it is.
what type of movies do you not like?
i really don't like horror movies, and i don't really like thriller movies, either.
why not horror?
i'm not a fan of blood and gore even if it's fake and i don't really like violence even if it's acting, so i just kind of stay away from that kind of movie cuz i just don't enjoy being scared either.

what did you enjoy or not enjoy about this movie?
i like the characters and the humor, i also like the story and the overall tone.
thank you for your help and have a wonderful day!
what types of movies do you dislike or not enjoy at all?
why don't you enjoy these types of movies?
is there a specific title from this category that you dislike heavily?
sure. out for justice is terrible.
what did you like or dislike about this film?
good god. so, the acting is abysmal. the story line is both simple and bad at the same time. they have steven seagal doing entirely too much on his own. they have supporting cast that basically is as bad actor as steven seagal is maybe to not make him stand out too much
when you can get to a fight scene, they're okay. but it's it's just a lot to go through. it's dark. it's it's just not bad it's amazing to me he's had such a successful career.
have you seen shawshank redemption?
oh, absolutely.
what did you like or dislike about this film?
shawshank is an excellent film, excellent. should have won the oscar. it is just superbly acted. the script is brilliant. it is it's really pulling you in and making you care about people who you otherwise may not. it's making certain characters sympathetic who otherwise wouldn't be. there are moments that are completely touching, which is amazing cuz you're watching something in a prison
then make a reading for the characters, if you there there really is a delineation between good and evil despite being in a prison. it's just that it's a phenomenal movie and the acting, and the writing, and the direction are top notch.
a lot of people will agree with your point and would go as far as saying it's one of the best movies of all time if not the best
yes, and they would be correct.
thank you for your help and have a wonderful day
yes, thank you so much. you, too.
could u tell me what kind of movies you generally like watching
i like teen comedies a lot.
why is that
they are
they're like they're like regular comedies in that they're funny, but because they focus on high school, they usually incorporate some kind of a lot of times there's a romance in it. there's something sort of nice and simplistic about that time because there's only so much teens are sort of focused on. it's usually very much
you know, about a specific period of time, couple years, you know, they're 17. they're 16. it's funny. the romances are usually simple and cute, and nothing too overboard. they it doesn't usually veer off too much into where a movie doesn't necessarily need to go, and it takes away from the rest. but they're they're fun. they're enjoyable.
simple and cute. nice, i like it. could u name a specific movie you love that fits that category, and what u liked about this kind of movie
there's a great movie recently called to all the boys i loved before, and that's a really sort of fun and funny and endearing
teen comedy it has a great lead and it doesn't always happen but this one is pretty original which helped a lot. and it was just it was definitely fun the these are getting harder to come by at this point. they used to make them so much more often. so, when you find a good one like this it's it's a rare gem.
thanks for sharing. could u also name a specific movie that fits one of those categories and tell me why you didn't like that kind of movie?
sure.
what is that? john tucker must die, that's not a good one. that is a still a teen movie, but
that sort of that's one that sort of went off the rails. it's doing too much, trying too hard.
have you heard of the movie a walk to remember
sure.
have you seen it
yes.
do u like these types of movies
a walk to remember is not my favorite movie. i guess it depends on like these kinds of movies. i am not the biggest fan of the author of that movie. it's based on a book. and he kills almost everybody in his movies, so that's why i'm not really a fan. a walk to remember has the lead dies, so it's even though it's a teen movie, it's very sad. it's a drama
not a comedy, and she's sick. she's sick throughout the entire movie. there is sort of a nice, endearing teen love story, and you do get involved with the character, but she has cancer. she's dying, and she does die in the movie. and it's it's kind of heavy, so it's not really it's not fun. i can like these movies, but
they're the kind of movie let's say if i see it, i don't keep watching it. so, it's not my favorite to watch repeatedly at any strech.
got it. how about the movie crazy rich asians, have you seen this movie?
yes.
did u like this kind of movie
yes. love this kind of movie.
why is that
well, it's a romantic comedy, and it is a little more original. all asian cast, which is great, so it sort of adds a little bit something different by showing a different culture and how how it operates. so, that all works. and it's really funny. very talented cast. and despite it being a different culture, one we don't typically get to see as much
and the big screen in this fashion, it was also very familiar, very relatable, so it was very funny.
what type of movies do you like?
i like action-packed movies.
why ?
that has a lot of action in it for one. and i like fast paced movies, you know.
what is one of your favorite movies?
blade runner 2014, hey i like like that one.
what did you like about it?
what's not to like? action, fast pace, all the way around a good movie.
what type of movies do you not like?
i'm not into love stories. you know, and kind of slow, not interesting, you know.
okay. have you seen the movie mission impossible?
i have.
yes.
what did you like about this kind of movie?
it's like kind of the american james bond movie. i mean it's it's a lot of action, a lot of suspense, a lot of technology you know, that may or may not be fake. so, yeah, good movie.
have you seen the movie the mummy?
and yes, i've seen that one.
what did you like or dislike about this kind of movie?
it was it wasn't really suspenseful. it was a worse show. i don't like seeing that history in it, you know, what you knew was fate. it was interesting.
what kind of movies do you normally watch?
i really like superhero movies.
have you seen ant-man?
yes, i have.
what did you like about ant-man?
i love paul rudd, that's the lead, and he was great in it. a very good fit for the more humorous take that they were going for. and it it was sort of a lower key superhero movie, like not like heavy on the action, but that worked given the cast and the kind of superhero they were doing. it was really quite different, for a superhero movie, so it was good.
have you seen solo: a star wars story?
yes.
what did you not like about that movie?
i do like that movie. i don't like personally don't like the newer star wars movies as much as i like the originals from the '70s and the '80s, but i do think that these are good, that these are well thought out and continue the the imagery and the story very well. and they're very captivating, very engaging, with good action and good storytelling.
are there movies you tend to stay away from?
i usually am not the biggest sci-fi fan.
what makes you stay away from those movies?
so, sci-fi is not my favorite, they usually have aspects in it that are for one are a little scarier which is definitely not my favorite. and they are very science based which isn't necessarily the worst thing in the world, but sometimes they go a little too far into the world that they're trying to create and seem to almost confuse themselves with their cleverness. so, when sci-fi is well done i i certainly like
but more often than not, it seems that they bungle it, and it is a mess.
what do you think about forrest gump?
it's a it's a good movie, it's not my favorite but it's a very good movie.
what sort of movies to you like?
i like drama. i love a good drama, you know?

it was okay. i wasn't completely bored. it was kind of interesting, but it wasn't that great.
what did you like or dislike about that movie?
i like that it took place in singapore about a asian family a rich asian family which i guess we don't really see that much in any other movies or tv shows. but, i dislike the bias. i just don't think like they like it try to be funny it it wasn't really genuinely funny. i don't think the plot was super good.
i see. now, have you seen any of the jason bourne movies?
yeah, i seen most of them. maybe all of them. i don't know. i've seen three of them.
what did you think about those?
they're pretty good. maybe a little bit overrated, but i still enjoyed watching them.
anything in particular that stood out to you?
good or bad
i guess i focus on the bad, cuz that's what comes to my mind immediately. i just remember the camera work, and i think maybe it's the third one, or maybe there's a fourth one. the the last one that i saw, the camera work is horrible, like i could not tell what was happening in the action scenes. too shaky.
kind of gives you the sensation of motion sickness, huh?
yeah, i guess. it also gave me a headache.
yeah, you don't want to watch a movie that leaves you with a headache!
nope.
movies are entertainment, not pain.

got it, can you name a specific film you really enjoyed and why you enjoyed it?
yeah. i liked 40-year-old virgin. really like that movie because it was a really funny, good steve carell flick.
i watched it on a network. i didn't like watched it on online or out of theater i watched it on a tv network.
ok, can you tell me what types of movies you don't like?
well, i can tell you i don't like action movies. too much action for this soul.
ok, the action scenes don't excite you?
no. no, they don't they don't do it for me. no, i never get stimulated at the action scenes.
got it, can you name a film you didn't like? it doesn't have to be an action movie but it can be
i didn't like.
let me let me think, a movie i didn't like.
i try not to watch like bad movies.
oh, i didn't like sandlot i guess.
that's way back though.
ok, no problem, can you tell me have you seen the movie star wars
oh yes. i like star wars, yeah. yeah, i saw the first one for a a class i took in college, but i never i never saw i don't think i saw any of the rest of them, but now the first one. now the first one was really good. first one was really good but
i don't know. i think they're still coming out with star wars movies in today.
ok, what about the first movie did you like?
i thought the plot was good.
what type of movies do you enjoy?
i really like action movies.
what appeals to you with these type of movies?
they are exciting, sort of like nonstop, has a really good sort of speed to them. they're just not at all boring. they're also they don't tend to be realistic, so they don't remind you of anything about everyday life, so it's a good escape, and usually an exciting one that you can really ride out and you know, and watch and be engaged for 2 hours.
the adrenaline rush from these movies definitely draws people in
exactly.
is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
sure. i love gone in 60 seconds.
what did you like about this movie?
that has an ensemble cast that really works. it's clever we don't have a ton or at the time we didn't have a ton of action movies that were based around cars and car chases. so, it was a little different. and so the action was a little bit different and it was sort it was exciting to watch the car chases. so, it really worked. and it was it was pretty well written.
i mean the acting was excellent, and the writing was pretty good, so it was it was enjoyable action film but also one that was not as familiar as they had been making at that point. we had way more in recent years but at that time it was fairly original.
a cast can definitely factor into a movie's success and a great story definitely needs to be there too
yes.
are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?
i don't like horror films.
what about these movies is unappealing?
i'm not really a fan of scaring myself while watching a film. i like to just be able to enjoy it. and for the most part, a scary movie will literally scare me, possibly cause nightmares, so it's not something that i typically go into enjoying. it's something i go into with trepidation. so it sort of defeats the purpose. i i consider movies an enjoyment, so it really does defeat the purpose for me to be watching a scary movie.
is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?
what do you dislike about this movie?
so olympus has fallen is a action film that is around the white house that's not particularly good and it takes itself way too seriously. so even if it was decent enough it's not realistic enough for it to be taken as seriously as it was taking itself. so, it doesn't really work. i i completely confused the cast. the supporting cast is better than the leaders.
have you seen black panther?
i have.
what did you like or dislike about this title?
black panther is excellent. it's fantastic that it was a black cast, african american cast that is a superhero. it's just never they never have done it before. so it was refreshing. it was great to see. it was inspiring to see, and the movie was actually great. it wasn't even like it was some sort of a downgrade. it was an upgrade for superhero movies.
so, the the acting is fantastic, the story line fantastic, it was all around excellent movie.
it's definitely nice to see something new that is uplifting for people
yes.
thank you for your time and have a great day! bye!
thanks. you, too.
what kind of movies do you normally watch?
i watch a lot of comedies.
whats your favorite comedy movie?
my favorite is going to probably be best in show.
but that's a pretty that's i don't know, it's a smaller movie. i can name a more well known movie too.
why is it your favorite?
it is so excellent. it's hilarious while being clever and sort of subtle. it's the style of the movie is a mockumentary, so what it's mocking it pulls off extremely well, and the cast is just superb.
what movies do you tend to stay away from?
if there's a certain type that i stay away from, outside of i stay away from horror films for sure. scary kind of movies are not my thing. i'm also not the biggest fan of tear jerkers.
what was the last movie that was disappointing?
die hard 5. a good day to die hard. that was disappointing.
what made it so bad?
so a good day to day hard is the part of die hard series so this is actually the fifth movie in the series, not only is it by far the worst, it is
probably the weakest storyline, the one that doesn't use the sort of lead character of the series, john mcclane, which is played by bruce willis well. it had good action. that was basically all it had going for it, but even then, it just it just wasn't great. it was i think the wrong setting. i think a lot of a lot of bad choices for that movie.
have you seen reservoir dogs?
no, i've seen plenty of other tarantino movies, but not that one.
what do you think about the movie aliens?
woo, really too scary for me. i know it's an excellent movie, but too scary for me in general.
what did you like about it?
not much. i really haven't seen the entire thing. sigourney weaver's excellent, but in general, entirely too scary for me. i'd i'd have nightmares about that.
thank you for your input, have a great day
what kind of movies do you enjoy and why?
what kind of movie
i've always well, i can't say i've always, but i like westerns now. i used to not like them as a child and now as an adult, i oddly have grown to very much enjoy a good western.
is there a particular film you enjoy?
well, i used to not like the movie tombstone with dark holiday and well whiteout played by i can't think of the actors name now. kurt russell and i forgot who played dark holiday, but as a kid i always thought it was boring but
what did you like about that kind of film?
for westerns, i think it's how simple and it's always kind of just about a single moral or i mean, sometimes you can have it where there's fantastical elements to it that lend kind of itself to like the american fairy tale, sort of. but they're always very simple stories with a little bit there's almost
it's always action in there somewhere, and they are they are kind of relaxing to watch as well. and also, i'm interested in that that world that they exist in that that western world.
is there a particular movie you don't enjoy?
whereas the genre of romantic comedies i've i like the comedy part, but the romance once are always like there's a meet cute moment and then there is, you know, they they don't get together until the very end. it's very formulated kind of i guess i've just kind of bored by the formula, but if they focus more on the comedy, i like it. i like them more.
what didn't you like about that kind of film?
kind of was saying that the they very formulaic. they they don't necessarily take chances, you know what's coming. i mean they're good for probably to watch when is maybe raining on cable or something on tv, but i'm not ever going to like pay money to go to a theater to watch it unless i have to.
have you heard about the movie true grit?
yes, and i like the the co in remake and the original with wayne.
would you go see the movie ?
in the theater, yes. i think i did, the remake. i don't remember. i know i've seen it, though. yes.
have you watched the movie before?
what did you like about that kind of movie?
kind of what i was saying. it's kind of a
i don't know if the right term is bellwether or not. but it's a good example iof what those movies can be i think it's a classic movie that's why it was remade and has some that and like searchers have some of the best cinematography or classic cinematography you see in a lot of western, too.
what are some movie genres that you like?
i like i like prison movies.
like what?
like like the great escape, so it's a movie about guys who ran a prison camp in world war ii.
why is it one of your favorite movies?
the acting is really good in it, and i really like the plot. you know, there's a lot of plotting and planning by the by the prisoners to get out, and watching them work is a lot of fun.
what type of movies do you not like?
not a really big fan of of family movies.
why is that?
you know it it seems like when they say family movies it's mostly for kids and you know they just don't
they just don't really appeal to me that much. they're they're they're normally very low-level plots.
have you heard of the movie saw?
yeah, i have.
yeah, i've seen i've seen a few of them.
what did you like or dislike about this kind of movie?
i liked the first one because it was kind of novel in that you know, you were waiting to see what the twist was, or like if there was a twist, or how they were going to get out of it. so i think it was it was a simple but effective plot.
ok thank you
can you tell me what types of movies you like?
i like watching comedies, action, dramas sometimes. when i get spare time i like double into something new like documentaries or biopics.
ok, why do you like those genres of movies?
they're entertaining to me, i like the aspect of being
like action a lot because there's a lot of things going on at once, and when there's a lot of things going on, it catches my attention. like i have to know what's going to happen next.
great, can you name a specific film you really enjoyed?
specific film i really enjoyed recently was spider-man: into the spider-verse.
what about it did you like?
it was different. it was a different animation. it it was like a different cartoon kind of a movie. it had elements of comic books in it, and it explored a different super a spider-man that everybody wasn't used to, and it told a different story, instead of the same old story. and it dabbled into like the multiverse and different universes in the world.
got it, can you tell me what types of movies you don't like?
i don't like thriller or horror movies at all. that's about it.
why don't you enjoy those types of movies?
ok, can you name a specific film you didn't like?
i did not like i don't like any of the chucky movies at all.
got it, can you tell me have you seen iron man 3?
yes, i have seen iron man 3 and i enjoyed a lot cuz iron man is my favorite marvel hero in in the universe.
what are some movie genres that you like?
i like action films, drama, mystery.
why is that?
well, often i want just simple entertainment, but then sometimes if it's a drama, i like intelligent dialog, serious situations, that sort of thing.
what is one of your favorite movies?
the man for all seasons. now that indeed was a serious drama, and i like the intelligent dialog in it.
aside from the dialogue, what else did you like about it?
well overall, it was well acted. the action was very believable. you got to understand the characters' motivation, so it was a very compelling story.
what type of movies do you not like?
i i don't like horror films, although i do like vincent price, so occasionally i would watch one of those, but normally i don't like horror films. i also usually don't like animation, and actually, even though i like comedy, i don't like probably most comedy films.
why don't you like most comedy films?
i i feel they're too simple. they're sort of geared toward the lowest element, as far as the situation and dialog goes, so they lack the sophistication 
the old classic comedies had more meaningful situations than today.
what did you think of the movie pulp fiction?
i yeah, i i guess maybe because i had seen such good reviews for it, that i was expecting more from it than i actually got. i didn't particular care for it.
what about the movie the shawshank redemption?
yes, i i like that. once again, that that was a good drama with good characters good character personalities in it.
ok, thanks
i would like to know what kind of movies you like
ranges from science fiction, comedy, action-adventure, political thriller, thriller, horror to an extent. the only, really, i i've even i used to not like westerns, and i even like westerns now.
the only thing, really, i don't like are like hallmark-type sappy movies.
and maybe some rom-coms.
or musicals musicals too i don't mind.
what do you like about these movies?
i think it's the imagination in the the the thing that people like about going to the movies it transports you to a different world. first, at least that mean obviously for the science fiction genre. but it's a way to i can really lose myself in the stories and the excitement whereas the genres i don't like
for musicals there's not much plot usually, and i don't like the way stories are told through the music. i feel like it loses the point. it's not something that i enjoy. i don't like the songs usually and
i think that's what most people like about those movies.
can you name a movie that you liked a lot?
let's see.
well, recently just cuz it the third one just came out but the and i didn't really say it but animated movies like pixar-type movies how to train your dragon, that series is a underappreciated series i think in comparison to like toy story and other pixar movies. toy story would also be up there for me in terms of movies i like or a movie series i like.
nice. how about a movie that you didn't like. can you name one?
i want to say it's called it's kind a bit of musical. across the universe or it's the one where i forgotten the name. it's something with universe, and i think it's beatles reference, because all the songs in the movie are beatles songs. but, it's like a romantic story or something.
which also, i don't really like romantic comedies. i'm not sure it's a comedy, but it's definitely a musical. and i i just but name a musical, and i i probably do not like it. little shop horrors, i didn't like. though, parts of it, i kind of liked. i liked the plot of it. i just didn't like the music of it.
got it, so no musicals, even if it's about the beatles!
that's right. i like the beatles music but not in a movie form. i think it's just repetition of it. it gets tiresome. like if there's one song or two songs in the movie, maybe i can that's fine. but when it's like every 5-10 minutes or whatever, it breaks down to it gets tiresome. but i also don't like to listen to the same type of music. like i don't listen
to a whole album because i get bored by the end of it. so, it's probably just my preferences or you know.
have you seen pulp fiction?
yes, its it it will be on it would be up there in terms of one of my favorite movies.
nice! what did you like about it?
well, definitely for the time that it came out, it was so unique, that nonlinear kind of storytelling narrative that is a little bit more commonplace now. though you don't see it too often. but it it was the it was that tarantino mix of like ultra-violence, unpredictability, great dialog, and you just never
i think the whole movie is kind of like that.
what kind of movies do you like, and why do you like this type of movie?
i like science fiction movies. i like science fiction movies because they always have interesting stories, and they deal with crazy new technologies or futuristic technologies.
can you name a particular movie that you like?
blade runner, i really like blade runner a lot.
can you give me a couple of reasons why you like this movie?
it's it's about cyborgs and it has harrison ford in it and i really like that and he's a bounty hunter and i've really liked the concept of bounty hunters. i think it's fun.

well, at this time of the year i always try to watch die hard probably 100 times.

i think it's the
how realistic it is. it doesn't feel dumb. it feels like a guy would actually be making these decisions. he's not doing anything stupid. he's trying to it's a normal guy in a extraordinary situation, and he has to figure out his way out, and everything in it feels natural or i mean, it's heightened, cuz it is an action movie, but it it it doesn't make you feel dumb watching it, which a lot of action films i think do.
ok, well how about a movie you did not like?
well more recently, the cloverfield paradox on netflix, which i i tend to like sci-fi, which is why i and i like the cloverfield movies, but cloverfield paradox just was it didn't make any sense. it clearly felt like a it had a good cast. it had it looked good, but it was clearly a dump
by the studio cuz it is not a good movie. it just didn't work, and i felt like i got suckered in by marketing.

rapid fire kind of dialog and there's sterilized dialog with the violence. and you can tell that he really love the what he is doing that and i think that comes in the screen and the dialog and the characters and the way it's acted. and the stories are usually just simple but unique in their own way. like pulp fiction is, you know, revolutionized movies and are not
and many are story telling kind of way and, yeah. it's you never know what you are going to get but you also kind of knows it feels familiar. like every tarantino film feels like a tarantino film and but you never know what he is going to do next. and so it's always a fun little adventure with him.

ok thanks for the input
what kind of movies to you like, and why do you like this type of movie?
i really like dramas. i don't like every single drama but i do like that that they can take sort of a slice of life and make something special out of it. dramas are usually the most realistic and the most ordinary type of movies that you can go and see. so, there are makers who can make something special out of sort of an ordinary is quite an accomplishment and enjoyable to watch.
can you name a particular movie that you like?
sure. good will hunting is one of my favorite movies.
can you give me a couple of reasons why you like this movie?
sure. the cast is excellent. the writing is superb. it is really it was so original and so insightful for who the characters were. very and the movie was incredibly endearing and incredibly touching.
can you name a movie that you do not like?
sure. i don't like the titanic.
what do you dislike about this movie? please give me 2 reasons.
sure. it is an epic film, and to me, it doesn't do well with its epicness. it is rather ordinary, and the two main characters, while likable, would have been better suited for something of a smaller scale, despite the overall grand nature of the story they were trying to tell in the historical aspect. and the other thing is that it just
it's it's so such a over hyped movie and it's just, i don't know, ordinary. it's not something that's overly enjoyable and it's nothing that you want to keep watching over and over again. it having a good soundtrack or two likable characters out of, i don't know, a hundred isn't something that you should should get loaded over so much.
do you like the movie insurgent?
i do.
what do you like about this movie? please give me 2 reasons.
sure. insurgent is a sequel to divergent and it i like the first one and the second one is very good. it is a good a really good continuation of the of the story and it's a a nice sort of second look into the characters that we met the first time but in a really showing them in a completely different not a completely different make but in a different light that we saw
first one in the first one they were battling for something competitively different than in the second one even thought they are related, so it really did carry a long the imagery well. it was very enjoyable.
do you like the movie interstellar ?
i haven't seen interstellar.
have you heard of this movie?
i have.
would you go see it?
i would, but it's probably something that i would it's more likely that i would see with a friend who wanted to see it more than i did.
do you like the movie solo: a star wars story?
yeah, i i like star wars movies. yes.
what do you like about this movie? please give me 2 reasons.
sure. it is star wars mythology and the world that they create is really something special, and this definitely continues that. the other thing is that it's just it's quite a world that they've created, so it's exciting. so it really is a nice escape, and it's incredibly detailed, so it helps to sort of create this other world. it's a lot to follow, but it is enjoyable.
do you like the movie batman v superman: dawn of justice ?
it's not my favorite. no.
why do you dislike this movie? please give 2 reasons.
sure. i think it was poorly thought out. i think the so i think it was poorly thought out, and the writing, because it was poorly thought out, suffered. like they didn't they knew they were trying to do a movie that included both characters, so they were trying for something interesting, but they didn't have anything that really connected them that warranted making a movie.
thank you for your feedback. enjoy your evening.
thanks. you, too.
what sort of movies do you like?
i like dramas.
have you seen the shape of water?
yes.
what did you like about that movie?
i like the fantasy aspect of it and it's just like a different world that was fun to watch.
what is a movie that you have seen recently that you really liked?
cameron the miseducation of cameron post
and what was the reason that you liked that movie so much
i think it was fun because i'm in a gay community and i think it was an accurate interpretation of what's happening. and how it goes about how i believe that, the rightness of coming out.
what about a movie you have seen recently that you didnt like
i did not like sorry to bother you.
what didn't you like about it?
i thought it was inappropriate, and it wasn't realistic, and it just made me feel weird. i thought it could have been really simplified.
have you seen harry potter and the chamber of secrets?
yes, i have. i loved it.
what didnt you like about that movie
no, i loved it. there wasn't anything i didn't like.
what kind of movies do you like to watch
my favorite kinds of movies are romantic comedies.
can you name a specific movie that fits that category, and tell me why you like that movie type
sure, like
notting hill it is
sort of heart-warming and funny, and it has a happy ending. and the romance is always fun to watch develop and play out. i really like the lightheartedness and the comedy of the movies. i there's sort of enough bad things going on in the world, that i don't need to watch a ton of it in a movie. so, i like lighter, funnier comedies, and romantic comedies are my favorite kind of
thanks so much. how about a movie that fits that movie category that u didnt like, and describe what factors you didn't like about that type of movie.
sure. so like love adores is a easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life. it is it has actually a very good cast, but the script and whatever they are trying to do in a movie is so flawed. that one is an approach where they have two women who are sort of friends and they are traveling together and they're
embarking on sort of a new part of their life, but to say it doesn't work is an understatement. it's it's very bizarre. it sort of starts as like a romantic comedy and turns into a bit of a thriller, which it's based on a book, and i never read the book, so i don't think that's how the book turns out, but it's completely unexpected and not how they sold the movie. and so that was bad writing, really bad directing, and just a bad idea in general, despite having
sort of a well known and trustworthy cast to pull it off, but you can't pull off something that's this bad.
thanks for the description on why you didn't like that movie type. have you seen the movie to all the boys i've loved before
i have.
did you like that kind of movie
i love that kind of movie.
why is that
that's more like a teen movie, another favorite genre of mine. i love teen movies. they are sort of like they actually are almost, in many ways, either a mini comedy or a mini romantic comedy. except, because they're teen-focused, they are even more simplistic, because they, you know, they're young, they only have so many things going on, you know, it'll be it's like sort of, you know, their problems are limited to
mostly boys' school, girls', maybe getting into college, that kind of thing. but, they don't have a a ton of real life problems going on. so, it's pretty simple. and so but, there's still a lot you can do. and it's good for the audience because we all had to go through that time, so it's something easy to look back and laugh on. but, yeah. in the movie in particular, unknown to me, the girl who stars in it was really good. and really the
the movie felt really original, so it was a welcome surprise.
what kind of movies do you like, and why do you like this type of movie?
i like action movies because they get me hyped and pumped up.
can you name a particular movie that you like?
die hard
can you give me a couple of reasons why you like this movie?

you too, bye.
hello
hello.
what kind of movies do you like?
dramas, mostly.
why do you like those kinds of movies?
if they are written well then the story and the character are usually engaging and i find it to be a good exploration of the human condition.
can you name a particular movie you like?
yeah, her.
what did you like about that movie?
i loved that it was i mean, even in a somewhat not too distant future or whatever, with a lot of technological convenience and you know, relative prosperity, that people can still end up alone somehow. i think that's incredibly valuable and worth exploring.
i see. can you tell me a movie you did not like?
sure. let's say the 50 shades series. i didn't like any of those.
how come you did not like those?
i thought that the i think that the material is terrible. i think that it should not have been green lit either as a book or as a movie. and, i am disappointed in at least american audiences that it has made as much money as it has as a series.
did you like the incredibles?
yeah, i did.
nice. how come you like superhero movies?
i well truthfully, i really enjoy seeing the visual effects and the sound design. i'm always i'm always mesmerized by the things that you know, visual artists and animators are able to come up with. plus there's sort of an element of i like to put myself in the shoes of a superhero and imagine that i'm them, but i don't get too carried away with stuff like that, usually.
thanks for your input

well, how about a movie you disliked?
let me think about that for a minute

now i watch a lot of different types of movies, but i like mysteries and thrillers quite a bit.
what was the last movie that surprised you?
the last one i watched was called prisoners.
what made the movie surprise you?
it just had an unexpected twist at the end that i didn't see coming.
what movie did you see last that was disappointing?
can't really think of any off the top of my head that i saw recently that were disappointing.
have you seen bridesmaids?
nope.
have you seen ant man?
yep.
what did you like the most about that movie?
i guess i liked that it was a comic book movie about not a standard like superhero. it wasn't like a superman or a batman or like one of the more famous ones. and it had paul rudd, and i like paul rudd a lot, so that was a plus.
have you seen aladdin?
yes, i have.
what don't you like about aladdin?
i can't really think of anything i don't like about aladdin. i like pretty much everything about that movie.
what are some type of movies that you like?
i like drama films, and i also like films about sports
what do you like about dramas?
i like their plot. i like the romance in them.
you know, it's interesting you should ask that, because i i really do enjoy the drama films. and they go back to like the core of acting too, like there's not a whole lot of like action in there. like i really liked about schmidt. i don't know if you could call that a drama film, but there's a lot of drama in that film.
so aside from the drama what else did you like about that movie
the deadpan acting from the lead character is really funny.
well, the film is a lot funnier than people like actually think it is. some of it some of it did get a little like over the top like the guy the like before the wedding he took like a ton of prescription pills and like that's not realistic. but it was really really funny.
can you name me a movie you didn't like?
yeah, i didn't like
jeez, the bye bye man i really didn't like.
just such a stupid idea. i heard one of my co-workers say like, oh, it's a bad film. it's a bad film. it's a really pathetically named film. it's really awful. i'm like, all right, i should go see it. then. of course i go see it and it turns out to be absolutely a hot pile of garbage.
so your coworker was right then
yeah, absolutely. she was absolutely right.
have you heard of the movie big hero 6?
no, i haven't heard of that movie. i don't watch like a lot of new movies, i don't really watch a lot of. i like some of the older movies, but i i really haven't watched movies in a long time.
okay. have you seen the movie inglorious bastards?
no, i haven't seen that movie.
what about black swan?
no, i haven't seen black swan. i've seen
oh, the burmese harp. i saw i saw the burmese harp.
how was that?
that was a really good movie. that was a piece on when the japanese invaded i think indonesia back in the '40s or '50s like during world war ii. it follows this guy who like finds this buddhist monk and they play the harp. there is no real harp in it, but they do sing like home sweet home. it's a period piece, it's really gorgeously done. i thought it was really good. it's dubbed in english. it's not dubbed like it has subtitles in english. i think it's spoken in japanese.
what did you think of the ending?
the ending, oh, the ending was was really good. like, i think he goes home. i don't think there's like a love interest in the story per se. it's about war, you know, it's about war. and he goes on this beach once. i think it ends it ends on a ship with his like wise buddhist giving a statement of like he might be reading, no, he's reading he's reading the guys that he's reading the protagonist letter as all the japanese troops on the ship go home.
okay. thanks
what kind of movies do you like?
comedy
i like funny movies.
what is your favorite comedy?
the hot chick.
my favorite comedy is the hot chick.
what is a movie that you recently watched that disappointed you?
a movie that i watched recently that disappointed me? that's a hard one, i have to think about that. maybe the movie samson.

how they treated samson so badly.
have you seen the movie the matrix?
the matrix. i've seen bits and pieces of it. it's pretty old.
what do you not like about the matrix?

i have seen the hunger games. i have watched the hunger games.
can you tell me what types of movies you enjoy watching?
drama, fantasy, documentaries. sometimes family, but that's about it.
and what do you like about those types of movies?
the storytelling if it's pretty good. i like how detailed and creative that people can get with different characters and different plot making, so i think you can really make up a lot of stuff.
alright, what’s one of your favorite movies?
well, back to the future, the whole trilogy, i guess.
and what was it about those movies that made it enjoyable?
just the storytelling and the characters and how over time like what happened. like it was a lot of surprises, and the heroism of the main characters
ok. now tell me about a movie you didn’t like.
i guess super troopers, cuz it was kind of one of those movies that the comedy wasn't as good as it could have been, and it was it just really wasn't funny. it was corny and dorky, and how they initiated and executed like you know, just parts of the story of
so it wasn't that great.
i see.
have you seen the guardians of the galaxy?
yes. first one.
what did you think of it?
i'm i'm glad that they included a lot of the characters that are a part of the comics and but, they could have made the part a little bit better towards the end. i didn't like the outcome and
but the second one is better. but yeah, the first one was kind of i didn't really care.
i saw bits i saw more bits of the second one. i didn't see all of it, but from what i saw, it was better.
ok. and have you seen a space odyssey?
i've not seen the space odyssey.
have you heard of it?
no.
i don't think i've heard of that.
alright, what about the justice league? have you seen that one?
i haven't seen that one yet.
i heard the end of it wasn't that great.
like spider-man dies or something.
aw, man! so not very interested to see it?
not really. i'm more interested in like the single comic book characters like batman, like dark knight. i saw those. superman one was okay. like man of steel.
captain america
fair enough. what did you think of captain america?
i like i like how they built up the story and how he went to the army and just the cinematics of it was very good.
i agree!
it went into more details in his story.
they were like like the new spider-man: homecoming i think with the the kind of i don't know. it was cheesy. it wasn't like more serious, like even the first the second one with andrew garfield was pretty good.
it showed gwen stacy instead of mary jane, so but they were still both serious installments.
i get it.
well, thanks for being such a good sport and discussing your movie preferences with me today.
i enjoyed it. that was pretty good talking about some movies. i hope you enjoy rest of your day.
thanks you as well!
what kind of movies to you like, and why do you like this type of movie?
i like action movies. they are sort of exciting, usually fun and really quite an escape from, you know, your real life. it's usually not something you are going to be encountering. so it's really an experience you are not going to be you can really embrace yourself and and not think, "oh, this is real life and it's about to happen." so it's it could be a lot of fun, very exciting
and sort of a real thing you can immerse yourself in for a few hours.
can you name a particular movie that you like?
sure. i love bourne ultimatum.
can you give me a couple of reasons why you like this movie?
sure. bourne ultimatum is a excellent movie on literally every front. it is a excellent acting, excellent writing, excellent direction. the direction is usually overlooked but the directing is phenomenal and it helps make the movie absolutely perfect. it is a very tight movie. there is barely a a a second that is wasted.
and i don't know. let's say the movie is like 2 hours or 2 hours and 20 minutes or something. it feels like it goes by so quickly because it's just it has such a rhythm to it, and you're just immersed and involved with what's going on. and it's a character you can root for, and just people you like and this is a continuing series, so you really know the character already, and you're really there to root them on.
can you name a movie that you do not like?
yes, unlike so many i did not like dark knight.
what do you dislike about this movie? please give me 2 reasons.
sure, dark knight is a batman movie, and batman already had an original, and it's so the problem of dark knight for me is is not true to the comic, and we saw a movie that was great and true to the comic. so, i don't like the joker character, it's not that bad. keith ledger was bad as the joker necessarily, not exactly, it's that it was not written very poorly. it was so dark.
so the two things i really don't like are it wasn't funny which is what the joke was supposed to be and the writing was extremely disappointing and very dark so just it was a a just bad all around for me.
do you like the movie guardians of the galaxy?
that's not a movie i have seen, but it's the kind of movie that i would like, that's a superhero movie.
do you like the movie the purge?
oh god! no.
what do you dislike about this movie? please give me 2 reasons.
sure. i don't like horror movies, so i don't like scary things, and i don't like sort of things that are meant to just sort of scare and gross you out, which is what the purge is trying to do.
do you like the movie it's christmas, eve?
i'm not sure i know that movie.
have you heard of this movie?
i don't think so.
would you go see it?
it kind of sounds like something that i would see, yes! it does.
do you like the movie the nutcracker and the four realms?
i like the nutcracker. i'm not sure what the four realms is. i was at the new one. yes, that would be something that i would see.
do you like the movie harry potter and the half-blood prince ?
no.
why do you dislike this movie? please give 2 reasons.
sure. first real reason is i am not a harry porter reader therefore not really a harry porter fan and in general i don't like fantasy movies not a rule but they're not my favorite type of movies.
thank you for your most insightful feedback. enjoy your evening.
thanks. you too.
awesome, well what kinds of movies do you like?
i really love comedy movies.
well, tell me why do you like comedy movies
you know there's a lot of stress in life and i just like to kickback, put on a funny movie and just laugh a lot.
cool, what is your favorite movie
i really love road trip.
alright, why is that your favorite movie
the characters getting in a lot of silly situation and i just pretty much laugh the entire situation.
interesting, is there a movie you do not like
i don't like paul blart: mall cop.
oh, why not
didn't really like the main character and just the entire situation of the movie just didn't really sit with me.
ok, then have you seen the movie johnny english strikes again
i have.
what is it about this kinds of movies that you like or dislike?
it was really interesting to see a character
completely oblivious in serious situations, and i laughed a lot during the movie.
wonderful. thank you for sharing. good bye..
what kind of movies do you enjoy and why?
i like the really like the thrillers, you know, stuff like memento or you know, something that's got some twists and turns in it. maybe it makes you think it's going to end one way and then ends the other. i like the sixth sense or that gone girl was pretty good, even though it was kind of
it was kind of easy to tell it was going, but it was still still pretty good. also trying to think of another one.
is there a particular film you enjoy?
yeah, the usual suspects, because mainly because i really when i watched it the first time, it's one of those movies that you can't really i mean, you can watch it more than once, but you the first time you watch, you won't know the twist, so it really kind of grabs you. and with that one, i really didn't have any clue. i mean, usually you might have some kind of inkling of what's going to happen, but with that movie to me, it just really kind of grabbed me, and i was like, man
it left me kind of speechless at the end.
what did you like about that film?
i liked that i didn't i couldn't predict the ending of it. you know, like i said just a second ago. you know, it was really a unique movie, and you know, just had a a great ending that you really just did not expect at all.
is there a particular movie you don't enjoy?
i wasn't a huge fan of the harry porter movies. it's not that i didn't enjoy them so much, it's just, i don't know, i just wasn't i never read the books i guess i just wasn't as interested in them as everybody else. i actually
i don't think i've seen all of them to be honest. i never watched the first couple.
what didn't you like about those films?
oh. i don't know. it's nothing really particularly you know, not any one particular thing. to me, they were just kind of boring and i don't know. i mean i it's odd because i generally like those kinds of types of things, but to me something i guess maybe if i would have read the books as a kid, then i would probably you know like it more. but it just wasn't all that interesting to me.
have you heard about the movie get out?
yeah, i actually haven't seen it. i'm not a big horror movie kind of guy, either. but i heard it was good. i probably will watch it. like i said
would you go see the movie get out?
i might netflix it. i didn't go see it when it was out, or i don't know. you know, now that you're saying it, maybe i should go to the box and rent it tonight, cuz i'm pretty sure it's up there. but i had heard it was good. it just didn't
it's just not my kind of thing, really.
did you see the movie the movie overlord?
is that the one
with the nazis and zombies, i think. if it is, i haven't seen it. i think i saw the preview for it at something i went to not too long ago. yeah, it's not generally something i would probably go to the movies and see. but i would probably i think it was either directed by eli roth or if it's the one i'm thinking about, or he was a producer. so i probably would watch that one, but no, that's not something that i would go to the theaters and see.
have you heard about the movie thor?
yeah, i saw that. i've seen all the thors. i like it. the last one i thought was really good, probably the best of all of them.
what did you like about that kind of movie?
just the hero kind of thing and you know i like the moral universe movies, they are really good
see you later
goodbye.
what kind of movies do you like?
maybe sci-fi and action, probably my two favorites.
why do you like sci-fi?
i don't know. it tends to be i guess the most interesting to me. it's difficult to explain exactly why that would be. but i'll think of something else. i'm interested in future and technology, so perhaps it relates to that.
is there a particular movie that you like?
the matrix jumps to mind.
why did you like the matrix?
it was really good, the action was great, the dialog was good but most importantly the concept was pretty unique and interesting and
nice, how about a movie you did not like?
i have never really liked any horror movies, with possibly one exception for the ring, which was pretty good. but for the most part i would pass on all those.
why don't you like horror movies?
they are just terrible, i don't understand why anyone would like them. why would you want to scare yourself?
well, then have you seen the movie deadpool?
deadpool i think had a couple of sequels. i think i saw the first one, but i'm not sure if i'm getting it confused with one of the later ones.
ok, what was it about deadpool you liked or dislike?
it was okay. i didn't have any particular opinion about it honestly. it was kind of edgy i guess in a kind of new way, but i wasn't a huge fan to be honest.
what kinds of movies do you like?
i like comedy and action, sci-fi, animation, and horror movies.
why do you like action movies?
they get you into them that you feel involved in the movie when you watch it.
is there an action movie that you liked?
right now am watching skyscraper.
and i liked the the marvel movies as well.
what is it about skyscraper that you liked?
i haven't seen all of it yet but it looks interesting.
ok, how about a movie you do not like?
i don't like too much the medieval movies, you know and stuff like harry potter. i wasn't that big into and and stuff from that age in time.
well, do you not like fantasy movies?
it depends what the fantasy movies are about.
and i'm not into western movies, either.
ok, have you seen inception?
no, i haven't seen that one, yet.
have you heard of it?
yes.
do you plan on watching it?
i might get to it eventually.
it seems interesting.
ok, have you seen ocean's eleven?
no, i have not seen that one.
have you then seen black panther?
yes, i like that one. that was good.
what is it about thee kinds of movies did you like?
they make you feel involved in the movie, and you're interested in watching them. you don't get bored, and you don't feel like you want to get up and and do stuff around the house, or anything.
and what about it do you dislike?
i guess just ones that are kind of boring and make you wish you were doing something else instead of sitting there watching it.
awesome. thank you for sharing.good bye
what kind of movies do you like?
i like action movies.
any other types?
i like romance movies.
is there a movie you really liked?
let's see. i like the terminator.
okay. what stood out to you the most?
what stood out to me the most was the time travel.
what else did you like about it?
i also like how machines are as smart as the humans.
anything else?
no, that's it.
alright. can you name a bad movie?
i think i like all the movies i watched.
did you like the avengers?
yeah. yeah, the avengers, yeah, it was pretty good. i liked it.
great. what did you like about that kind of movie?
it was there was a lot of superheroes and action in the movie, and a lot of fighting, and that was fun to watch.
is there something else that stands out about this kind of movie?
i don't think so.
alright, did you like dunkirk ?
i didn't watch it.
okay. do you want to see it?
i don't know what it's about.
ok. how about birdman
never watched it.
ok, how about harry potter and the chamber of secrets
yeah, i watched that i watched that before. i liked it.
great. what did you like about that kind of movie?
i like the magic and the fantasy genre, and the setting.
got it. is there anything else that came to mind about this kind of movie?
not really.
what kind of movies do you enjoy and why?
i really like superhero movies.
is there a particular film you enjoy?
yes. i would say
x2, like x-men 2 is probably my favorite of the superhero movies.
what did you like about that kind of film?
superhero movies are sort of like action films but with a different storyline, a different lore, based off of the comic book, so it has the movie has great action, but also for a very kind of important and engaging storyline, and really well-developed characters. that's the big difference about superhero movies and regular action, is the
are incredibly well-developed because of the source material, so it makes for a very interesting movie. usually very entertaining, very engaging, and a great escape.
is there a particular movie you don't enjoy?
i'm not a big fan of captain america.
what didn't you like about that kind of film?
i don't really like the colors of the movie. i found them too i found the movie boring and the colors to add to the boringness. i think in general he's just not my favorite superhero, but it's made worse by just how sort of mundane everything about him is and how in comparison especially to other movies. it's not that exciting, so i don't know it's just sort of
every time i try to watch it, i fall asleep. it it's it just bores me.
have you heard about the movie venom?
yes.
would you go see the movie venom?
i think i would, especially if a friend wanted to go and see it. i think i would.
have you seen the movie iron man?
oh, yes. of course.
did you enjoy this kind of film?
yes. iron man is one of my favorites, superhero or otherwise. it is great casting, really exciting and fun scenes and fun and exciting action, so it really works. the weakest part of the story line is the first half hour, and on a rewatch, it makes way more sense than it did on the first time i watched it, so i just enjoy the entire movie now.
until next time
bye.
i’d like to discuss your movie preferences. ok?
okay.
i personally like dramas.
what was the last movie that you watched that you enjoyed?
the looking glass
what did you like the most about that movie?
i love the plot, the acting was superb, the direction was pretty good, i like the writing, and altogether, the reception that it had in reality.
what about a movie that you didn't like?
i did not like halloween.
what didnt you like about halloween?
i don't like bloody movies and that one it's also like seeing really fake to me. if it's going to be a horror movie it needs to be based in reality.
have you seen forrest gump?
yes.
yes, i have.
what did you not like about forrest gump?
i thought it was pretty not a real story that could really happen, and i don't like how they mixed up the reality with the fantasy.
thank you for your input, have a nice day
can you tell me what types of movies you like?
yeah, i like horror movie and action movies.
ok, what about those genres do you like?
there's incredible there's guns, action, excitement.
ok, can you name a specific film you liked?
saving private ryan is one of my favorite movies.
what about that movie specifically did you like?
it it was an epic depiction of world war ii.
ok, can you name genres of movies you don't like?
musicals
why don't you like musicals?
they annoy me. i like movies that have a theme that isn't being sang.
ok, can you name a specific movie you didn't like? it doesn't have to be a musical but it can be
a specific movie i didn't like?
the newest ghostbusters in 2016.
ok, why didn't you like that movie?
got it, you feel like it didn't live up to the original movie?
yeah, that's correct.
ok, can you tell me have you seen star wars: the last jedi?
yes. it was fantastic. i enjoyed it because i loved the spaceships, and i loved all of the the characters of star wars.
what kinds of movies do you like?
i like all kinds, but i really particularly like drama you know, like feel good movies. you know, something like forest gump. something with a good story and you know, it just kind of leaves you with a good feeling at the end.
why do you like dramas?
you know, it's just the escape of it all, and a good drama has just enough reality in it to
to, you know, make you think it could happen to you, you know, it's kind of believable. it's not like a lot of the fantasy, we totally like some of those too, but, you know, it's the drama you can almost picture yourself in the movie a lot of times or people you know and stuff like that. kind of easy to relate to.
what was it about forest gump that you liked?
how he kind of fell into all that stuff that he did, like he didn't really plan it. he just it just kind of happened to him. it's hard not to like that movie.
well, would there be a particular movie you did not like?
i don't know about a particular movie. i'm not a big fan of documentaries, usually. i mean, unless it's like some of these true crime ones are kind of good. like making a murderer, but it's not a movie, but it's you know, a series. something like that is is i do like those, but just not some of the other ones. you know, i'm just not a big fan of watching animals or
you know, rain forest and stuff like that.
i kind of like you know you know, just regular type movies.
so, have you then seen die hard?
i've seen all the die hards. i think there's a new one coming out. and even though the last one really wasn't very good, although it did have timothy olyphant in it, i will definitely see the the next one. i'll keep watching them probably as long as they make them, cuz they're just so fun. it's a christmas movie, you know, the first one.
what was it about die hard you liked or dislike?
well, the first one's just the story was you know, i mean it was kind out there, but it was bruce willis probably the main reason i like them. i'm a fan of his, and the first one was just very clever, and the dialog and you know, the quippy remarks, all the crazy stuff that he did. it was just a fun movie to watch and
you know, mainly coz they are fun they're just fun movies. i mean you know they could nothing like that could ever happen but its just fun to watch it on tv or on the screen.
wonderful. thank you for sharing. good bye
i’d like to discuss your movie preferences. ok?
yes, i like to watch action movies.
what appeals to you with these type of movies?
they're fun. they're exciting.
is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
die hard
what did you like about this movie?
i liked the end.
fact that bruce willis's character was a real person, not a comic book character or anything like that, just a real guy in a difficult situation.
are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?
i enjoy all types of movies.
what about these movies is unappealing?
no. there is no type of movie that i don't like. i watch anything.
have you seen the shawshank redemption?
yes, i have.
what did you enjoy or not enjoy about this movie?
well, the entire thing was great. just very well plotted, well written, clever. morgan freeman was great in it. i'd love to see it again.
thank you for your help and have a wonderful day!
what kind of movies do u like watching?
i like watching both war movies and documentaries.
awesome. can u name a movie that fits one of those categories that u really enjoyed?
i would say
the king of kong, the fistful of quarters, that was a pretty good movie.
what qualities about that movie did u enjoy?
i enjoyed that it was something that was a bit obsecure. like when most people when they think of video games they're not thinking well, most people are not thinking of arcades. so, when i think of a video game documentary, i don't think of arcades games. i don't think of
competitive arcade games, so that kind of shone some light on on that whole scene that i'd never knew existed. and you know, it was pretty cool. like they even you know, i they kind of dramatized it a little bit, which, i mean, was whatever. but it was also kind of a nice twist because it it made it a little more entertaining, without necessarily
overdoing anything?
thanks for sharing. can u give the name of a movie that u didn't like that fits the categories u mentioned?
i didn't care too much for the wizard of oz. just because it
i get that it's an old movie so like i understand. it comes from a different time but it just didn't really resonate with me all that well.
what about the movie didn't u like
i didn't like the cliche plot line which, again, i'm sure at the time it wasn't cliche because it's such an old movie, but like to me nowadays just kind of seemed cliche. it was
i don't know. just like i said, it didn't really resonate with me. it's not to say it was a bad movie. i just didn't really like it.
it helps me to learn more if i know specific reasons why it didn't resonate with you. for example, the costuming, or the story line
yeah. the story line wasn't all that great to me. the costuming, yeah. that was shaky at best. which again, i know it's an old movie, but
it just seemed a little weird, out of place at how badly done it was compared to today's movies.
what kinds of movies do you like?
i like action movies and comedies.
awesome, why do you like action movies?
because of the guns and the fast cars, the cool actors.
they are extremely interesting. they're never boring. they're always fast paced. that's why i like action movies.
is there an action movie you like?
yes, i like the action movie twister.
why did you like the movie twister?
because it was relevant to actual things that are that are actually happening, natural disaster, something that we face every day. it was realistic, that's why i liked that movie.
alright, how about a movie you did not like?
i did not like the movie deep impact. it was overdramatic.
what was it about the movie deep impact you did not like?
it was extremely overdramatic and it wasn't very realistic.
and that was the biggest reason that i didn't like the movie, was that it was not realistic.
so, have you then seen forrest gump?
what was it about these kinds of movies you like?
forrest gump was a very emotional movie. it had a character that was you could cheer for and root for, and you hoped he would succeed. i think that's what i like the most about forrest gump, is it was a very true and authentic story. it was a beautiful story.
ok , thank you for sharing
what type of movies do you like?
i enjoy family, fantasy and mysteries.
why fantasy movies?
i just like the fantasy part where you can enjoy watching something that is not common or doesn't really happen and the idea of that being able to happen one day.
what is one of your favorite movies?
one of my favorite movies was something i watched as a child and it's still is one of my favorite movies the neverending story.
why?
i just thought it was a great movie, it was a good family movie. there was nothing unclean in it, makes you use your imagination. it was interesting and fun.
what type of movies do you not like?
i do not like musicals.
why not?
i just don't like that type of when i'm watching a movie, i just mainly want to watch a movie. i don't enjoy the that type of singing, and it has it too often in a movie for my personal preference.
have you seen the movie twilight?
i have.
what did you like or dislike about this kind of movie?
i liked the supernatural part of it, the vampires and that fantasy part of the movie. and there was also a bit of a love story in it. i enjoy that.
what did you think of the movie harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban?
i thought it was a good movie it has a lot of magical and
things in it that
so, it's fun to think about that kind of world.
okay. thank you

what do you enjoy about them?
they're just funny, and they make you like if you're in a bad mood, they help you feel better. they're just really like enjoyable movies to watch.

what movie from that genre do you enjoy?
what did you like about it?
i mean, it's just it's one of the funniest movies i've ever seen, and it's really quotable, and has bill murray and rodney dangerfield and chevy chase. it's just a really good movie. it's really funny.
it seems like a strong cast for a comedy movie, definitely seems enjoyable
are there any type of movies that you dislike?
i'm not a big horror movie person.
what don't you like about them?
i think it's mostly just how much they use jump scares. like if there's horror movies that don't use jump scares that only use one or two i fine with it, but i hate jump scares. i need horror movies that rely on them. i can't stand watching.
is there a particular movie that you dislike?
i saw the santa claus. for real the kids and i hated that movie. that was the first thing that came to mind.
what did you not like about it?
it wasn't funny and it just wasn't a good christmas movie. ideally i like christmas movie and i like the first santa claus. i never saw the second one, but the third one was just awful.
have you seen the movie frozen?
no, i have not.
how about aladdin?
yeah, i've seen aladin.
what did you like or not like about it?
that's one of my favorite disney movies. it's funny, and the music's really good. it's just i don't know. it's a movie i always like watching. it's always enjoyable.

i really like the movie inception.
and can you tell me what you liked about those types of movies?
i like i like how they portray a world that could be our own. you know it's not exactly fantasy, because it could actually be it could actually happen in our near future. you know, i just feel like i feel like i could get lost in the movie, in the story line and i just forget about my own boring life.

you know what? i don't like that movie at all. i thought it was yeah, i did not like it.
can you give me a couple of reasons why you dislike this movie?
yeah, i mean the biggest reason for me is that it sort of sets up this premise where it's like it's legal to kill people or do whatever you want on a particular day, but it doesn't really you know, it doesn't really say there aren't consequences to your actions. so it's kind of like a it's kind of like a it's kind of like a stupid premise, you know? i just don't think it's realistic. and i also

what type of movies do you like?
i really have discovered that i like horror movies a lot more than i thought i did. i'm a i'm a big fan of horror movies.
how did u discover that?
well, it just kind of dawned on me that i really enjoy when there is a good horror movie. so, i guess, you know? it's it has been kind of a long term in the works. there there're a lot of bad horror movies out there, so you know? it's hard for me to find a lot of good ones that i like, but once i have started to watch more, i realized that i'm really into them.
what is one of your top horror movies?
one that i saw recently it was called the witch. it's it was pretty interesting. i i hadn't seen a horror movie done like that before.
what else did u like about it?
it's it takes place in on the frontier, so it's kind of a period piece but and and and it doesn't it doesn't rely on the kind of the tradition horror movie tropes too much.
can you name me a movie you didn't like?
a movie i didn't like, i did not like the movie armageddon.
why is that? because of the plot?
yeah, the plot was kind of was kind of silly, and i thought the movie totally went of the rails toward the end. i mean it the premise was okay, and then you know, the buildup of them making the team was good, and then it just kind of was just totally goes off track and doesn't make sense.
have you watch the movie justice league?
i can't remember, i usually see most of those superhero movies. i i honestly don't think i can remember if i saw that one. i thought i did, i don't know i don't know.
what about the movie ender's game?
i did see ender's game, and i also read the book, and i thought the movie did a good job with the subject. so i thought it was pretty close to how the how the book went.
what else did u like about the movie?
i thought the performance of the of the the kids was pretty good. i mean child actors can be sometimes the performance can be not that great, and i thought these kids did a great jobs with their roles. they made it really believable.
okay. thank you.
what kind of movies do you generally like watching?
i like comedies. i like
good dramas. highly rated dramas. and then i like superhero movies.
why do u like these types of movies?
well comedies i like them if they're good, if they're clever, if they're funny. dramas it usually has to have good a good story, good actors. superhero movies, i mostly like the marvel ones that come out, rather than dc. i think they do a good job with the marvel movies.
could u name a movie that fits one of the categories you mentioned, and tell me why you like that kind of movie
sure. avengers: infinity war is a movie that fits fits in the superhero genre. i just thought it was really well done. all the characters are funny and likable. it's a good story, and it all fits together really well.
thanks for sharing. could u also name a specific movie that fits one of those categories and tell me why you didn't like that kind of movie?
yeah. justice league is another superhero movie. i didn't like it that much.
i only like a couple directors of batman, superman, and wonder woman, but i didn't like some of the others. i didn't really find them any interesting. and also, it's a little bit corny it didn't it also didn't fit together very well. i thought the story was not great.

i forget the name of the the actress that was in it, but that's good characters, good story all around, good action.
what was good about the movie
well i found the story interesting and kind of compelling, i guess. 
and the acting i thought was good, too. it wasn't as corny as some other james bond movies, or wasn't trite, or anything. he was actually kind of sophisticated.

is there a particular film you enjoy?
yes. 10 things i hate about you is one of my favorite movies.
what did you like about that film?
it is
really well acted. it has for a teen movie in particular, it has really good acting, really good writing, and also a very interesting story line. it's actually based off of shakespeare, so it has more to it in the story line than a typical teen movie might. and it's it's fun. it's funny. it definitely has this one definitely centers around romantic relationships. it has a ton of comedy in it, as well. so it flows really well, but in other interesting way
and the casting across the board is really great.
is there a particular movie you don't enjoy?
sure. like i didn't like a teen movie i didn't enjoy? i didn't like superbad that much.
what didn't you like about the film?
so to me, this was a very hyped movie. it was touted as sort of like a a great teen film, and i was let down by it. it's not that it didn't have some funny lines. it did, but for the most part, they were already featured in the commercials. so the movie itself, it came i know it sounds strange to say for a teen movie, but it came across very juvenile. a little too simple. it seemed to be i don't know, going for
what a teen movie what like adults think of what teens are doing. it was very simple and just it's just not that funny it's not something used for a teen movie. i usually love it and i re watch it a million times. i've never re watched superbad and i have no plans to.
have you heard about the movie high school musical?
yes.
what would you like about thid kind of movie?

my favorite is is a little film called local hero that was made about 30 years ago.
alright, why is that your favorite movie
i'd say a bill forsyth film who made a bunch of smart comedies in the '80s and '90s and i think it's the best work that he did trickily a great performance by burt lancaster and peter riga.
interesting, is there a movie you do not like
a movie that i don't like. i'm trying to think of one in particular last or recently that that didn't impress me much. i wasn't crazy about the greatest showman.
oh, why not?
it was just too over the top and had some working some trendy social themes and i didn't think the music really worked on. it was a bit of hacking and and it was all that wrong.

what kind of movies do you like?
well, my favorite kinds of movies are pretty much maybe sci-fi dramas like the matrix and mr. nobody. i also like comedies a lot, and
guess some adventure movies are okay.
what do you like about these kinds of movies?
can you name a movie that you really liked?
i really liked mr. nobody because it told the story of making choices. it had it had like a kid, his parents got divorced. and he had to choose to go with his mom or his dad. and it shows you different different paths that he took. it was three different paths so.
just so like pre-law universities or something.
so, that's pretty much with that.
nice. how about movies that you don't like, can you talk a bit about them?
i don't like
let's say i just i i just don't like a lot of family dramas. i don't like a lot of comic book like the like some of the marvel stuff that's coming out. i don't really like the story telling they're doing with that cuz it's not the same as how they were written back in the '60s like in the actual comic books some of the superhero movies. i don't like reboots. like they keep rebooting spider-man
and i mean it's cool that they're doing that, but i just i just don't like that they're changing up the characters like they're changing the race. i mean i get that there are social quality and going on and, you know, they want people all to be accepted by their change in their character that's in a comic book. there could be a white character changing into a girl, it could be a gender change, or it could be a racial change. it's just not how it went.
i mean i'm not saying that you can't do that, but it's not how the story went. stick to the story. be authentic, so
i don't i don't really like those kinds of movie like that.
and chick flicks, as well.
can you name a movie that you didn't like?
oh, i kind of didn't like spider-man: homecoming a little bit saw a little bit i just didn't like how the characters were developing it wasn't the same as the amazing spider-man which was pretty good the one with tobey maguire which was spider-man 1 2 and 3 with venom like all those were just i thought were all well written and good good directing and characters.
and that was lacking in homecoming.
so, it's pretty much that one, too.
have you seen aquaman?
i've not seen it, but it actually looks like it's okay. it's kind of kind of looks like they added too much cgi to it, and i'm not a big fun of overusing cgi. i think it's good to use but not that much.
okay.
how about pulp fiction?
pulp fiction was pretty good. i thought john travolta did good in it, samuel jackson was all right. i think i saw it maybe a couple times. a lot of people say it's a cool classic. i thought quentin tarantino did good directing in it, too. so,
what did you like about it?
it was kind of threw you off a lot at times. it was different things going on in the movie.
so, that was pretty cool.
okay, we changed to like another another scene and
and it would go to another one. they just had like different things going on, so
a little bit of action, a little bit of comedy. that's about it.
nice, well thank you for the chat!

bye.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like action films.
what do you like about these kind of movies?
i like sort of nonstop action. the the the action sequences are usually exciting, and fun, and maybe gripping, and intense in a good way. there's usually it's usually quite an escape to watch an action film.
nice. can you name a movie that you really liked?
mr. & mrs. smith is one of my favorite action films. it's a it's brad pitt and angelina jolie and so great cast and this particular action film great cast, great action, great writing with sexual aroma that's paired into it which i really love and it has a lot of great back and forth a really great script which does not always
when you have a great script in action movie, it does make it that much better.
what kind of movies do you dislike?
i don't like horror films.
what do you dislike about them?
i don't like scaring myself. i don't like the blood and the gore that comes with the horror. i don't like in general just trying to sort of like scare myself to the point of maybe having nightmares later on. that's not something i'm into.
can you name a movie that you didn't like?
in general or a horror film? cuz i don't have horror films that i watch enough to dislike. i just don't watch them.
in general
and into this day. it was one of the most baffling movies i've ever watched from what it was supposed to be and what it ended up being. it was terrible.
so the acting was good but the story was bad?
i wouldn't say the acting was good, but it did have good actors in it. there was nothing really good about the movie.
but the actors are known quantities who are in it, so i wouldn't blame it on the acting. it wasn't there were the actors sort of who are in it are they're award-winning actors, so it was really not the acting.
i see. have you seen the favourite?
no, i have not.
i know the movie but i haven't seen it.
how about la la land?
yes.
what did you think about this movie?
i thought in a vacuum, it was a good movie. if looking at it just strictly as a if you take exactly what they're doing onscreen, i think it's a very charming, likable movie. stepping away from it, i think there's a lot of flaws to the movie. there is it's an incredibly white, caucasian movie for a movie to be about jazz, and be almost completely white, caucasian is ridiculous.
there's the one black guy in it. they have the white guy telling the black guy about jazz, so a lot of things about it don't ring true, but if you are just watching the film and trying to enjoy it for what they put on the screen, it's a very likable movie.
what kinds of movies do you like?
my favorites are romantic comedies.
why do you like romantic comedies?
i like that they are funny and a little more lighthearted and have a happy ending.
is there a romantic comedy movie that you like?
yeah. one of my favorites is called the holiday.
why is the holiday your favorite?
it has a really really good cast, and it is the writing is great. it's very endearing movie. actually, surprisingly endearing, and multiple times, and it's just refreshing. it's really easy to watch. i i i watch it every year.
well, is there a movies you do not like?
yes. the ugly truth, that's a romantic comedy i don't like.
why did you not like this movie?
it is billed as a romantic comedy, but it's kind of more a gross out comedy. and it just doesn't work. it doesn't have sort of like the regular elements of a romantic comedy, and it has a more gross out juvenile humor. the lead in gerard butler leaves a lot to be desired. it's just it's a bad casting for katherine heigl, even though i usually like her, but not in this. it's just it's wrong on so
many levels. it was from start to finish terrible.
interesting, have you seen the movie bohemian rhapsody?
no, that just came out, but i know what it is.
do you plan on seeing it?
i'll probably eventually see it. yes.
ok, have you seen the movie bridesmaids?
absolutely. yes.
why did you like this movie?
it has a really good cast. it's an ensemble cast. a really good cast. literally, every single casting works, even though at the time they were kind of a little bit more unknown. the writing is very clever, it's a very original, it's also a little more out there. i like more absurd humor, and this has parts of that in it. and it's it was a movie that was more traditionally would have been something that starred men.
so it was special that it starred women.
what kinds of movies do you like?
i love comedy. i love foreign movies.
well, tell me why do you like comedies?
because they make me laugh whenever i'm upset. they bring good mood in me whenever i'm down, lonely.
they make me laugh a lot.
cool, how about a movie you liked?
i liked the movie called the little man.
so funny. very funny.
why did you like that move?
because it's so funny. i can't stop laughing whenever i watch that movie. even when i'm annoying, i just love whenever i watch it. it's so funny, and it has a cool story line.
interesting, is there a movie you did not like?
yes.
the wrong turn
oh, why not?
because it's it has a lot of thriller thing. i don't like watching blood out of people. i don't like watching people being killed. i don't like watch to watch people die and that kind of stuff. i'm scared of seeing people being slaughtered alive. yeah.
ok, then have you seen the movie inside out?
okay.
yes, i've seen the movie. i've watched it like twice, but i didn't like it. it got me really scared. i couldn't even sleep at night.
what is it about this kinds of movies that you dislike?
the thing is that i don't find them interesting at all. all they give me is scared thoughts that i can't even sleep alone in the house, can't walk around the house at night.

does it seem like a movie you would be interested in seeing in the future?
yes. it would be an interesting movie to see in the future, because i just like the action, just just the shooting, just the violence in it.
do you like movies like when harry met sally or good will hunting or transformers
i liked good will hunting.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you like the most?
i kind of like drama movies in general, but i also like the story seems like it could be something that would happen. and also it's robin williams, and i'm a fan of robin williams movies.
can you say a little more about that please?
i just think i also just think the acting in the movie is really good, cuz you usually don't get to see robin williams in a serious role, so it was neat to see him like that. and also, i like matt damon.
anything about this type of movie that you dislike?
not particularly. i guess some of them in the genre can feel not like they'd be true, like they're too far-fetched, but that's about it.
ok. what about the other 2 movies when harry met sally or transformers
i've never seen when harry met sally, and i've never seen transformers, either.
what about the movie the hunger games or trainwreck. have you seen any of these?
i have seen the first two hunger games movies.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you like?
i just think they're interesting stories, and it's just a neat concept, the idea of people being trapped in a place, and they have to kill each other until only one is left.
anything else?
the characters are neat, just to see how they interact and how they deal with the situation that they're put in, cuz it would be hard to imagine yourself in that situation, so it's neat to see how people react.
and what is it about this type of movie that you dislike
i guess like the hunger games specifically. you can tell it's written for teenagers. there's just a lot of melodrama in it. just feels like you're friend for teenagers, but it's still a good movie.
what about the movie trainwreck. have you seen it?
i have not seen it.
have you seen the movie bridesmaids?
no, i have not.
what about the movie named inside man
nope. i haven't even heard of that.
have you seen the movie goodfellas?
i've seen like 10 minutes of it, but never the whole thing.
did you like it?
from what i saw liked it.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you like the most?
i like movies about crime or like gangsters and just how people commit crime and the like intricacies of the back end, so how they deal with each other.
can you say a little more about that please?
i guess that's just interesting seeing like true crime i mean i know the movie is not true crime but the way that true crime works in the real world and how mob the mob and the mafia work and stuff like that
anything about this type of movie that you dislike?
i guess that there is a lot of them, really there used to be. back in like the '80 to '90, they made a lot of them.

comedy
why do you like comedy?
it makes me laugh.
and think positive thoughts
is there a particular movie you like?
the toy, you ever seen it?
why do you like the toy?
well, had richard pryor in it for one, that should explain it by itself.
it was extremely funny.

wonderful, than you for sharing
hello. what kind of movies do you like?
i think i like mostly action movies, but i really like things that are character development driven so things have a very pronounced story line.
why do you like these kinds of movies?
i like them because i figure if i want to spend money in order to get into a movie, i want to have something that really resonates with me, something that i can really remember for a long time, cuz i don't tend to re-watch movies, either. so i really want the moviegoing experience to be an actual experience, so it has to be memorable and something where i can really take away something from the character interactions.
wow, great details!
can you name a particular movie that you like?
i think one movie that comes to mind is inception, because it has really good action and really good character development, and it has a nice twist at the end. it's not a super big twist, but it is a twist.
can you name a movie that you do not like?
i didn't really like [inaudible]
what else did you not like about it?
i felt like the overall story was just kind of boring, you know. you go to find the oasis, the oasis isn't there, so you just go back and you take control of the base. so it was really just not overall a gripping story. i didn't really feel like there was too much suspense, and the characters did not really grab my attention too much.
do you like the movie reservoir dogs?
i do like the movie reservoir dogs.
can you give a couple of reasons why you like or dislike this movie?
yeah, i like it because it has really great dialog. it was run by a director that i'm a big fan of, tarantino. it has really good action, and i think the cast is always pure superbly acting. so i think it's a really great movie.
do you like the movie whiplash?
i've not seen the movie whiplash.
do you like the movie the shape of water?
i like the shape of water. it's pretty interesting. it has a nice storyline. it has good acting. not my favorite movie, but i still appreciate it for what it is.
what two things do you specifically appreciate about it?
sure, i think it has a really interesting sort of character. i mean, who really wants a character who can't really speak, but it was superbly acted by the female character, 
so it was a really good attention-grabbing thing in order to get people drawn into the story, and i also like the relationship that the two characters have with each other, the amphibian and as well as the newt lady, so i think it's quite nice and it also has some really good action, some really good tension going on, so i think overall, it's a pretty solid movie.
thank you very much for the valuable feedback. good bye.
bye

i like action movies.
why do you like action movies
well, they're usually entertaining, and there's a lot going on.
soft and great movie scores

had the bad guys, had a lot of danger.
had a dashing hero.
and you name a movie that you do not like
oh wow.
well, i don't go see movies i don't like so it's kind of hard to say.
i don't like horror movies.
if you're talking about genres of movies
well, like nightmare on the elm street or something like that horror movie like that. pretty much any horror movie i don't like.
i'm not going to pay money to go get scared.
anything else in particular about nightmare on elm street or other horror movies you do not like?
i don't like being scared.
i don't like jumping out of my seat.
i don't find that fun.
he also often put women in particular in danger, which i find kind of annoying and i think it doesn't help the general society to see movies where women are in danger from pyschos.

world
what was it that you do not like about jurassic world?
i'm kind of a science person, so the whole idea just seemed preposterous to me.

how about the godfather?
well, it was certainly a classic and certainly held my attention.
it was a little gory, so
but i appreciated the skill with which it was made and how well it put as into that world.
so it was at least three stars and probably three and a half for me, out of four.

ok, can you tell me about types of movies you don't like?
kind of movies that i don't like. romance movies are kind of boring to me. i mean it's it's nice feeling, you know, we all like feeling love, and getting cuddly, but it's just it's incredibly boring.
got it, can you name a specific movie you didn't like? it doesn't have to be a romance movie but it can be
the notebook, i didn't like. and you're probably going to ask me why i didn't like it, and it's because it was boring. it was mushy, and it didn't make any sense. and women think that or the sad thing is that i think men feel like they have to do these like huge gestures to win a woman's affection, but that's not true at all. it's teaching teaching people the wrong thing. you have to be an adult. you have to be smart. give people space when they need it.
ok, can you tell me have you seen the movie the matrix?
i have.

ok, what about star wars do you like?
i liked the newer films a force awakens and the last jedi.
anything else about that genre you'd like to comment about?
i also liked the earlier trilogy, episodes ix, v, and vi, but i did not like the films that came out in the early 2000s.
oh and why is that?
i didn't think that they were particularly well made.
ah ok
how about justice league?
i don't know anything about that film but i would give it a try.
oh ok.
let's see...
how about the lord of the rings: the return of the king
the lord of the rings is one of my favorite trilogies.

thanks for sharing. how about a movie that fits that category that wasn't too great, and what made you decide you didn't like that movie type
let me think. i can't really think of any sci-fi movies i've seen recently. maybe the crow. the crow is not i guess you could say that's sci-fi. but i don't know. i just didn't like it. it was kind of overly campy, a little bit too self-serious, and it just kind of went all over the place.
got it. i understand. have you seen any of the avenger movies
i have.
do u like this kind of movies?
yeah, they're pretty good. i they're not my favorite, but i i've enjoyed all of them when i watched them.
why do you enjoy that movie type
they're really high action, they're really intense, usually pretty funny. the stories are not that great, but it's lightweight and it's just fun to watch. it's a popcorn flick.
what type of movies do you like?
i like action movies like you know some of the higher pace higher pace movies and
i also like you know the superhero movies. they're also kind of action movies, part action, part sci-fi. you know, the different dc and marvel movies that are out.
so do you like movies similar to fast and the furious?
they're not my number one favorite, but i do enjoy those movies. maybe that's
i mean, it's they're not they wouldn't be my top if if there was a choice between that and maybe say a new superman movie, i'd probably go see the superman movie. but if i'm not doing anything else, i'll definitely probably watch fast and the furious. i've seen the last couple for sure, so
some of them are definitely better than others.
what's one of your favorite movies?
i really liked the black panther. i thought it was a interesting take on maybe not as popular characters, you know? as thor and the hulk, and all the the other adventures. i thought it was a really well well done movie and it was definitely wasn't a typical superhero marvel movie, it went a lot deeper than than just that.
what did you think of the cultural aspect of the movie?
i thought it was interesting.
i like the way they tied everything in. it wan't very it wasn't so much preachy, but it was. you know? it it was more up to date. and i don't know if you've ever read many comic books, but a lot of the comic books especially back in when i first started reading them in the 80s and early 90s kind of looked to me sometimes get preachy. or but then i always had, you know? kind of
underlying messages in them, and i think this is it brought me back to a time earlier time reading comic books, i think.
i don't know. it just mean a lot more that to say some of the dumber you know maybe genre that are out. but, i don't know. it was just a really good up to date
marvel movie
what type of movies do you not like?
i'm not a fan of horror movies. not because they are scary just because i'm just not a fan. i don't i guess i was when i was younger, but i watched all those friday the 13th movies when they first came out. but, it's just to me they are just so over done a lot of times nowadays. and, now there seems to be a new one every week almost or every two weeks. i'm just not a fan. not a
i kind of been there done that kind of thing.
and that's a lot of the problem. if i can find one that'll scare me then i might like it, but it's been a long time since i've been scared at the movies.
i did not see bridesmaids, but i generally like those types of movies. but yeah, i didn't see that one, so i can't really say about that. but those types of movies, yeah. those buddy buddy type movies, kind of like the hangover. i did watch all those. those were pretty good. yeah, those are fun sometimes, if they're good. not so much if they're if they're just kind of not not very good. if they're not if they don't have a good writer, they're not as good. but yeah, movies like
the hangover. i like those types.
what about movies like superbad?
yeah, i enjoyed superbad. it was kind of ahead of its time a little bit. it's had a lot of imitators since then, but at the time, that was a
a really funny, hilarious movie, and i did enjoy it. i don't know if it'd hold up as much today, but it was certainly fun at the time watching it.

okay. how about movies that you don't like? can you describe them for me?
i generally don't like chick flicks, just because they're usually overly dramatic. and, well, i'm a guy, so i don't really relate to them in the same way.
so you like movies made for men?
i mean, they can also be gender neutral. it's just like the movies that tend to highlight women's problems like as the main focus of the movie. it's usually what i don't care for just because a guy now can't relate.
can you name a movie that you didn't like?
i didn't like twilight.
why is that?
well, it was very cringey, if you will.
like for one, the whole idea that the vampires sparkle instead of burning up in sunlight, like that just, you know, it it seemed cheesy. and then there was the whole fact that it was just a love story. and i mean, don't get me wrong, i can get into a good love story. but it just

eight crazy nights

i'm
well, in addition to finding it funny, i also found it funny.
but that aside, it was a good adam sandler movie cuz it was funny.

i didn't like it because it was dorky and cheesy.

what about the matrix?
yeah, that was a good movie.
so you like science fiction movies?
as a whole, i wouldn't say, but i like movies in the genre, like the matrix.
can you tell me what you liked about the matrix?
i think sorry, i like the underlying concepts of the movies like the whole red pill blue pill thing, you know just stuff like that.
what was your favorite scene?
probably the red pill versus blue pill scene. just cuz like you know, not having seen the movie before that, it was like a holy shit kind of moment.
got it. thanks for the input
goodbye
hello. what kind of movies do you like?
i like action movies.
why do you like action movies?
i like the the pace, the like nonstop aspect of it, and the really good the action scenes that have sort of lot going on that sort of keep you on the edge of your seat. those are always fun.
can you name a particular movie that you like?
one of my all time favorite movies is bourne ultimatum.
what are the 2 things that you like about this movie?
well, action movies are not known for sort of their screenplay like the writing. but the bourne ultimatum is excellent on that end. so it's a very complete movie, very engaging, and then the cast is excellent. but the entire thing comes together, the pace the action, the story. it's fantastic.
you give great details.
thank you.
can you name a movie that you do not like?
let's see. i don't like armageddon.
what are the 2 things that you dislike about this movie?
so the problem with the armageddon is it has action with no purpose and it has an incredibly incomplete screenplay like a story line. it's so concerned with blowing up things and creating visual effects which it did well, but it's too concerned with that so that it's a very very long movie and the story line is
shakey at best, it's really
it's it's a hard movie to get through the first time in the movie theaters. it's not one you want to watch again on tv, it's just not that good.
you would make a great reviewer. move over siskel and ebbert!
do you like the movie bridesmaids?
i love bridesmaids.
can you give a couple of reasons why you like or dislike this movie?
sure, bridesmaids is incredibly well-written. it is not overdone, so it's not trying too hard to go i think into sort of trying too hard to be funny is just sort of is funny the way it's written which is one of its true strengths. and the other huge strength is its cast which is in someway subtle and someway obvious. but for each role, it was just perfect
do you like the movie crazy rich asians?
oh, i haven't seen that yet, but i'm looking forward to it.
do you like christopher robin?
the movie, i have not seen that, i don't know if i will.
how about dumb and dumber?
not my favorite.
what are the 2 things you dislike about it?
the juvenile humor was kind of expected, but it was even worse than i was thinking it would be, it is just so dumb. i understand the title dumb and dumber, but it's just so dumb so stupid.
i don't know, i guess. i think down to the audience entirely too much.
i agree. thank you very much. i love your reviews. good bye.

why is that
i'd like to feel connect to characters and cry you just have to feel real.

got it. thanks. and have you ever heard of the movie coco
yeah, i liked it. loved it.
why do u like this kind of movie
i like cartoons, and like coolness, and they were just like made me happy. made me still want to be like a real person. it was cool.

because sometimes i can't get into like the realities of things of real life, and this movie like reminded me that with the cartoon and the the sense of family just reminded me of that.
what type of movies do you like?

cos i like to laugh and because i'm like half depression so it helps me to battle it. and it does the right things for me which i appreciate.

so do you like movies like the avengers?
yes. very much so.
what's one of your favorite movies?
i really liked guardians of the galaxy.
why is that
well cuz it was funny and the plot the writing was really clever, and you know, they were traveling in a fantasy world, you know, places that you don't normally see on earth.
what about the plot?
the plot was it was set in outer space, and it was just it was an adventure. it was a superhero movie or superheroes movie, and they got themselves in dangerous situations, but they always found funny ways to deal with them.

no.
it doesn't have to be an all time favorite, just one that you can watch over and over.

the truman show made me think of a reality that was probable but different.

no.
what about jason bourne?
yeah, i saw it so many times on a bus.
and what did you think about it?
it was pretty cheesey.
what type of movies do you like?
why is that?
they are sort of like a romantic comedy because there's almost always that kind of component in it. and it's also just a sort of a regular comedy a lot of times. but with the caveat of they're younger, which makes the story line kind of simple. easy to like, easy to follow, easy to relate to. and it really just works, usually.
what is one of your favorite movies?
i really like the movie she's the man.
what did you like about that movie?
she's the man is has a very good base for a movie. it's actually based on a shakespeare's novel, and it is interesting from a story line, also interesting in execution how they go about it. the cast is really good, very engaging, very likable. there's a lot of funny parts to the movie. their romance is very cute. the friendships that you see on display are very nice.
and the school setting really works.
i really liked the work out scene
yes.
what type of movies do you not like?
i usually stay away from scary movies, like horror movies.
you don't like being scared?
i do not like being scared.
have you seen the movie zootopia?
i have not.
what about the movie the matrix?
oh, absolutely. i've seen that.
what did you like or dislike about this kind of movie?
matrix is like a epic and it is at the time it was incredibly original, very sort of far reaching and what it was going for in terms of imagery and storyline. it was quite an undertaking but really works. it's you have to sort of just in some ways turn your mind off and other ways turn your mind on and just go with what they're trying to do. 
the sort of action sequences are great in the movie. the acting, especially from the main cast, is really well done. and it's a really interesting and encapsulating world that they're sort of taking you into.
that's very true. did you like the first one or the sequel?
i liked the first one better than the sequel, but the sequel wasn't bad. sequel wasn't bad. but the first one is the best one.
have you seen the movie tag?
no.
what about the hunger games?
yes.
what did you like about this kind of movie?
well, for hunger games, i do usually i usually appreciate it even if i i don't like a movie that is based off of a book. the better base for a movie story line is usually from a book. there's so much more material to draw from in trying to make a movie adaptation. this is a great movie adaptation. it's incredibly engaging. it pulls you in. 
the lead, in jennifer lawrence, is extremely well cast and just excellent in the role. it's sort of a bizarre dystopian world they're taking you into. and it's executed beautifully, despite how bizarre, really, that the world is that they that you're going into.
okay. thank you

what kind of movies do you like
i like sci-fi movies. and i like superhero movies and the occasional comedy.
what do you like about them
usually stars the actresses that i like or actresses that i like, i'm just a bigger nerd. so sci-fi is a is a great genre for me, and i like a occasional comedy something like from adam sandler or some other comedian.
adam sandler, ok which movie you like with him in it
my favorite adam sandler movie is the waterboy. and i don't like his newer stuff, but definitely his older stuff from the mid 2000s is is is all good.
the waterboy, any particular scene you remember
yes, any scene with rob schneider in it in the waterboy. i just love it.
ok so what is the differences between adam's newer movies to his older ones
his newer movies lack the comedic output as his older ones. his older ones have almost all original ideas, and his newer ones are seems like it's more made for, you know, like a family environment, like a family comedy rather than, you know, adult comedy. or just stupid stupid comedy, so
ah ok, so its more family oriented now, do you think he lost his touch?
well, he's still funny. he's just not as funny as he used to be. so, he might have lost a little bit of it, but still he's movies is still entertaining, but just not as much as so.
gotcha, so he is still a good comedian ,what about other movies you enjoy
thats not funny
i like the sci-fi movie called event horizon.
if i had a choice between any movie i want, i would probably pick a sci-fi movie like event horizon or one of the newer star trek movies.
ah ok, cool. lets talk about movies you dont like
okay. i don't like romance, and i don't like period-style pieces either, or history related movies.
ok would you go watch lets say the notebook if someone invited you
no, i wouldn't.
why not
because it's a waste of time.
what is it about romance movie you find waste of time
they're boring. there's no action in them. and their stories are pretty repetitive.
would you be ok with romantic elements in movies like star trek or star wars?
no, i think those scenes are also a waste of time.
gotcha, so what scenes you think worth the time and money
well, like i said, it non-romance scenes is is worth the time and money. like any scene that, you know, actively moves the story along rather than, you know, normal scenes that just are there just to waste time.
ok any scenes that are active and comical is fine
is that right
yeah.

thank you for your feedback. enjoy your evening.
what kind of movies do u generally like watching
my favorite movies are romantic comedies.
why do u like those type of movies
they're lighthearted, usually fun, has a happy ending, makes you laugh. so, they're very easy to watch, easy to enjoy, and a nice sort of escape from like a hectic lifestyle.
sounds great. thanks for explaining. could u name a movie that fits that category and tell me what you like about that kind of movie
sure, like my best friend's wedding is one of my all-time favorites. that is has a great cast. it is actually a little bit of a longer movie and a little more in depth, but it it's enduring, and it's funny, and you grow to like the characters, and you just sort of laugh and go on a ride with them
you laugh a lot in that one. it's just a really good one, and you can watch it over and over again.
that sounds like a great movie. could u tell me about a movie that fits that category that you didn't like, and what you didn't like about that kind of movie
sure, the ugly truth was a terrible movie billed as a romantic comedy, but more like a gross up comedy, and just because it has a, you know, sort of a romantic setup with a male and female lead who are going to be dating or falling in love or something along those lines, it really needs more than that and
this movie was lacking and it despite it what they thought when they put it out, it was so bad and in general, i actually love katherine heigl movies but i do not like gerard butler movies and he is the lead actor in this and it was just rough from all around.
have you heard of the movie mary poppins returns
yes.
did u see this movie
i have seen it.
did you like this kind of movie? and why or why not
i do love this kind of movie. it is not the original, and it is i don't think anything ever could be the original, but it is a nice tribute to the original. and i love musicals. they are sort of very involved and fun and, i don't know, hearing music is always an enjoyable aspect to sort of this kind of experience. it's kind of like stage coming to a movie.
and this one was particularly well cast and well-thought-out, i think in a way to be endearing, while not trying to compete with the original.
that's a great way to describe musical experiences. thanks for sharing your perspective. i appreciate it
what kinds of movies do you like?
i like action movies, comedies, and documentaries.
well tell me, why do you like action movies?
action movies are fun to watch. they're entertaining, and they have interesting characters and scenes that i enjoy watching.
alright, is there a movie you liked?
i love die hard.
oh wow, why do you like die hard?
die hard is great. because bruce willis is really great in it. i also like reginald veljohnson and alan rickman is a real classic in his role.
i agree
interesting, is there a movie you did not like?
failure to launch
oh. why not?
it's just a bad movie all around, didn't interest me at all.
can you explain a little bit more?
it's just a bad romantic comedy. sarah jessica parker's not very good in it. and i didn't even like matthew mcconaughey, and he's usually great.
ok, then have you seen the movie john wick?
yes, i have.
what is it about these kinds of movies that you like or dislike?
well, i like movies with a good story, as well as great action and interesting characters that are really compelling.
wonderful. thank you for sharing. good bye.
bye.
what type of movies do you enjoy?
i love romantic comedies.
why do you enjoy these type of movies?
they're really easy to watch, really enjoyable to rewatch. they're happy, they're funny, they can be heartwarming. so they're just they're pleasant a very pleasant form of entertainment.
i can definitely see the appeal in that. is there a specific title that you enjoy?
i love sleepless in seattle.
what did you enjoy about this title?
it well first of all, it has an excellent cast, and it's written by somebody probably who does the best who's done the best romantic comedies over the years, nora ephron. and it's just it's clever, it's funny, it's very original. there's a good back and forth, and it's just charming it's really charming.
what types of movies do you dislike or not enjoy at all?
i don't like gross out comedies.
why don't you enjoy these types of movies?
very juvenile very juvenile on humor, very juvenile on execution. i don't need to watch somebody, i don't know, throw up 10 times or i don't know, just act like a child when they're an adult with like two children and a wife or something. so, they're kind of pointless in so many ways and i just don't need to waste my time on that.
i can definitely see why some people would shy away from that type of humor.
is there a specific title from this category that you dislike heavily?
maybe the animal?
the one that has rob schneider in it. ugh. that wasn't good.
why don't you enjoy his titles?
he leaves a lot to be desired as an actor. he is not nearly as funny as he thinks he is and he
yes, it really is very juvenile. it's a lot of his stuff is based off of saturday night live skits and the things that really should have kept to just a skit. they don't have enough to make into a movie.
have you seen i feel pretty?
i don't think so.
how about crazy rich asians?
that's that's the good one.
what did you like or dislike about this specific film?
first of all fantastic that it's an asian romantic comedy and the guy who did it he did he's done other good movies before. he's really good very good director, so flowed really well. the cast is funny and it's just nice to see something different on on the screen and really it was a little bit, different offered something different, despite being familiar and that it's a romantic comedy and it's funny. but, it was a refreshing change of pace.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like slasher movies.
why do you like that kind of movies?
because because it keeps me at the edge of my seat and it's entertaining.
just the gore makes me makes me happy
do you have a particular movie you have seen and liked?
yes, jason x.
what is your favorite part of the movie?
my favorite part of the movie is when jason starts walking around the spaceship and starts throwing his starts throwing his knife around killing people.
what about movies from other genre?
lord of the rings trilogy i liked.
do you like the notebook?
i've never seen that movie.
what about marry poppins?
never seen that movie either.
have you heard of that movie?
yes, i have heard of that movie.
would you like to see that movie?
not really, it's mostly for a woman mostly a chick film.
what about guardians of the galaxy?
i seen some of it.
do you like that movie?
yes, i do because there's a lot of action, lots of fighting
lots of people hitting other people.
lots of destruction
that is cool, so you like movies that excite you, is that right?
yes, that is right.
what kind of movies do you like?
yeah, i'm just watching right now bob and the trees. it's a movie about a lumberjack in i think western massachusetts and his foresting company. now, he's a lumberjack in real life. they shot this all in real life with real actors. the actors aren't actually actors. like they're real the the lead actor, he's actually a forester a licensed forester in massachusetts, and so he his son-in-law plays his son in the movie is the family business.
so i would say i mean i really do like those films. i like the indie films. i thought the script was a little weak on bob and the trees. otherwise, i mean it's it's pretty good. it's shot really well. the plot's good. a few places the script could have been changed. i don't think people actually sort of talk like that in real life. but apart from that, i thought it was shot really really well.
why do you like those kinds of movies?
i don't know.
more down to earth, maybe.
they feel like people i know.
ok. can you tell me a movie you did not like?
you know, it's funny, cuz i don't usually see movies i don't like, you know?
i would say though, if you wanted, i haven't really seen movies. again, like i don't like
i usually look at the reviews on the rotten tomatoes and then if i see if it's low critical ratings i'm like i'm not going to see this. i'm not going to spend my time watching this dumpster fire of a movie. so, usually
what about a movie you have seen and just did not like?
well i remember years and years ago, we watched i watched sandlot, and i didn't i didn't like one so much.
how come?
i don't know i hear it's a classic i hear it's a classic i just didn't like it.
how come?
i hear it's a classic i just didn't like it.
but why didn't you like it?
i don't. it's it's it's there's a lot of profanity in it. i didn't think that was super cool.
i think the writing was super loose to like to write it pg in those awful stuff. there is like is it it should have been pg 13.
ok. how did you feel about ant man?
no, i haven't seen it.
i just the only thing i've seen like super recently is the mr. rogers movie the won't you be my neighbor? i thought that was a really really good movie. sometimes like it got it got to the point like idealizing the points and it's my only really criticisms of it. it was shot really well. there's super cool archival footage in there. the interviews are really good. it was really sort of compelling as well because like it's co-star, the police the policemen on the show, are actually gay.
mr. rogers was an evangelist who would not normally support gay people, but he said like the gay guy said like he was a he was a he was father figure to me. it was really really interesting.
all right.
ok. thanks for your input today
hello. what kind of movies do you like?
i like horror movies.
what is it about horror movies that you like
they just give me some excitement, you know? i get excited and this adrenaline rush, but i just enjoy it in general.
anything else about horror movies that you like
the graphics, the demons, exorcism, everything. i'm just excited to watch this kind of movies you know like the jump scares, everything is exciting for me. other movies are boring for me to be honest.
can you name a horror movie that you like
the conjuring
can you name two things about the conjuring that you like
the jump scares, there were not that many of them, but they were perfect, to be honest. and also the the thrill, they keep you thrilled all the time without being extremely bored, like meh. just perfect.
can you name a movie that you do not like?
i didn't like the exorcism.
can you name two things about the exorcism that you did not like?
it was kind of classic horror, and i don't really like this kind of horrors. and i guess because it was old, i didn't like the acting. like it's a great movie, there's no lie about that. but it wasn't just exciting for me. like it it wasn't my thing. i felt like it was too fake.
do you like the movie aliens?
oh yeah. yeah, of course. of course i do like this movie, yes.
what 2 things do you like about it?
the monster like the graphics, sounds, and motion, and everything was amazing. also like the the acting of almost everyone in the movie was perfect, especially the main character she she was amazing.
what else do you like about aliens?
i don't remember the movie very well, to be honest. i don't remember what i used to like about it. i just like the fact that it's like like a different species invading earth, and i like this kind of stuff, you know?
do you like the heist?
what about the movie whiplash?
no. no, i didn't watch that, either.
how about hunger games?
of course. of course, one of my favorite.
can you name 2 things that make it one of your favorites?
could you tell me the type of movies you prefer?
i love action movies.
perfect! now, what would be one of your favorite movies?
i love mr. and mrs. smith. that's a great one.
got it. could you give me some reasons you enjoy that type of movie?
sure, but first of all mr. & mrs smith, i'm talking about the one made in 2006 with angelina jolie and brad pitt. its a tonne of fun, its actually is funny along with the action. the action sequences are really well done, really fun like just a lot going on but also well choreographed, good cinematography, and acting. and the movie is great, really makes a difference when the actors are good in the action movie.
ok thanks. how about a movie you really didn't like?
i really didn't like
quantum of solace
it's not the type of the movie. it really is that particular one. the new james bonds just leave a lot be desired. they used to be really fun action movies, little nod, little wink, and great action. the action has been tepid at best, and the story and the tone of the movie has gotten so serious, it's almost like a drama. and it's just not fun anymore.
so would you enjoy a movie like wonder woman ?
yes. very much.
and again, it'd be great to hear why you enjoy that type of movie
i love the female lead. i love the action. i like superhero. it has a lot of great things going for it. gal gadot's a great choice.
let's chat about one more movie. how about
mad max: fury road
i think that's a great kind of a movie.
it really has a lot going for it, but it good acting, good directing, really good scenes.
it was surprising surprisingly good because i don't really like dystopian futuristic stuff, but i think because of the casting in particular and the way it was done it was really good.
ok, is there anything else about that type of genre you really like?
no, its usually a genre that is a mess, but that was a good movie.
oh ok, thanks!
thanks for your time!
what kind of movies do you like?
i like documentaries.
what do you like about documentaries?
well, i like learning things and i like that i can experience things more vividly when learning about something than say through a book or through articles or whatever. like usually documentaries have relevant imagery you know videos shots from locations that they're covering or or you know
whatever it is, there's usually relevant video to go with it to add to the entertainment and interest.
what kind of documentaries do you like?
i particularly enjoy technology and video game related documentaries because i enjoy both of those. i like learning about their history, i like learning about different perspectives on on different matters.
nice, can you name a documentary that you liked?
anything by ahoi. retro ahoi. the previous documentary that was really good, really well researched, really well articulated. i mean just, it was like professional grade. should have been on tv kind of documentary, in my opinion, and he's just a youtuber.
how about the kind of movies that you didn't like, can you describe them for me?
i'm not usually a big fan of action movies just because they seem over the top and cheesy most of the time.
so you prefer more serious movies?
generally speaking again, it depends on subject matter but yeah

and i also like just the dramatics of the high budget.

i like fast and the furious.

i like romantic comedies.
so what do you think about the shape of water?
you know i know that was a highly rated movie, but for whatever reason at the time i didn't get into it or i didn't see many trailers for it, so i really don't know much about it. i think it won an academy award or two, but just never heard much about it.
do you think if you saw more about it, you would have watched it?
might have.
it's hard to say when you know very little about a movie, except that it had an unusual title.

oh. well, i watched sherlock holmes movies actually.
and i saw dunkirk recently.
on tv
do you like movies about conflicts?
i like history a lot, and so

well, there was action, there was some comedy in it that was fun, and of course wonder woman looks great. just looking at wonder woman is good for guys. but she was cool. she she had spunk, as lou grant would say.
and she could take care of herself, so
i liked assertive women.
is the matrix a movie that interests you?
the first one interested me. i didn't think the second and third ones were as nearly as good.
yeah. it's sometimes it just seemed weird for weird's sake, but it certainly held my interest trying to figure out what was going on.
it had an element of mystery to it, i guess you could say.
do you like or dislike the movie aliens?
oh, i dislike it. it's i don't know if it's officially a horror movie or sci-fi horror movie, but i refuse to go to any horror movies. i don't pay money to get scared.
what did you dislike the most about it?
well, jumping out of my seat.
being scared
that's not my idea of entertainment.
thank you for your input. have a nice day
thank you.
i'd like to know what kind of movies you like
yeah, i like any movies that have to do with the future, you know, like dystopian futuristic science fiction-type movies.
nice, what do you like about them?
it gives you kind of a weird and warped view into the future, and it kind it's just interesting that to see the worlds like different from the vision of the director.
can you name a movie that you really liked?
yeah, i'm sure you've heard of it. it's called the matrix. it's very popular. that really fits the bill here.
nice, what did you like about the matrix?
great story line, great actors, very believable. aand it feels like something that could really happen in the future.
how about the kinds of movies that you don't like, can you tell me more about them?
it's simple really. movies that i don't like is ones that bore me. i give all movies a shot. do you know what i mean? even if it's something i haven't watched before like a foreign movie, a subtitle movie, it can be anything. i will watch it and i will try to enjoy it.
right, most movies deserve a chance.
yes, i agree.
can you name a movie that you didn't like?
any of the twilight movies.
so you don't like when vampires shine?
no, and i don't like werewolves, either.
have you seen blade runner?
yes.
what did you think about this movie?
it was a great movie. it's older. it's very interesting to see how they thought the future would look back then. it it's gotten i should really rewatch it now that i think about it cuz i rewatched i watched the the sequel, which was okay, but not too great.
what didn't you like about the sequel?
the original movie had a specific ambiance. i guess it's hard to explain. it felt like you're part of a world that was woven by the director. the new one just felt like it was an action movie.
and there wasn't there wasn't that much. it felt like it was kind of drab. let me put it that way.
do you like how the first one has a more noir style?
yes, i think i think that's all right. i think that's exactly it.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like mysteries, adventures, and romance the most.
why do you enjoy these genres and is there a specific film?
let's see. gosh, there's so many movies i like. i really like titanic and movies like that that have adventure and romance in them. let's see. the stars that are in it, as well as the story, and there is you know a lot of action, kind of like i was on the edge of my seat the entire time.
is there a reason why you enjoy that movie?
i like a movie that has a fast pace.
is there a movie genre you dislike?
yes, science fiction.
is there a specific movie you dislike?
i really don't like the movies like the avengers and those types, the superhero movies.
have you seen the movie crazy rich asians?
yes, i have. and i really liked it.
what did you enjoy about it ?
i thought it was so funny and i thought that i wouldn't enjoy it because the stars of the movie were all unknown, but it didn't matter. they just the whole ensemble cast they all worked so well together and i thought the writing was really good the it just it made me laugh and i thought the story was really interesting, too.
have you seen the movie searching?
no. i haven't.
have you seen the movie bridesmaids?
yes, great movie.
what did you enjoy about it?
great cast and it was just hilarious. i just found it so funny and i think the cast was great and they were all comic actors and i i just i think that plus the rating just made an awesome movie.
do you like movies like the spotlight?
yeah, for the most part i do like movies like spotlight.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you like?
it's a controversial topic that is covering and it's trying to send a message about what they're doing now. it depicted a preachiness i think because that's what the journalists were doing but still came off a little bit that way but a really great movie and it doesn't take away from it. it's just a little bit i i still would put all the president's men of those kinds of movies ahead of spotlight one of the reasons because of that.
do you like movies like inside man?
i don't know that movie.
do you like movies like good will hunting?
love good will hunting.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you like?
well, for this particular movie, the cast was perfect. now you got the cast to be perfect because of the involvement of the actors in making the film, otherwise they would have gone for bigger names at the time, and a different cast, and it wouldn't have been such a good movie. that they came off as authentic to the boston area was an important part of the movie. the script is great. the actors are excellent.
it's believable, and also really hopeful. they're original story, which is amazing. really an amazing story that they came up with. and but also had moments of lightness to it that help balance out sort of the more serious journey that the movie takes you on.
can you say a little more about that please?
sure, the movie itself is rather serious. it's taking, you know, a guy who was sort of ordinary and not making a ton of money to being someone who everybody wanted sort of a piece of to study because his mind was so amazing, and it had been discovered. so it's a very serious movie, but him dating minnie driver's character, his involvement
storyline with robin williams is extremely serious, given his background. yet, the times with his friends, with minnie, with robin, where there's a few lighter moments that have to balance out the movie into a much more well-rounded movie than it otherwise would have been.
do you like movies like when harry met sally?
love when harry met sally. love it.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you like?
well, first of all, it's a romantic comedy, which is my favorite genre. when harry met sally itself is
exceptional in that it doesn't try to do too much except what they are trying to do. they are two actors who are really they are focused on mostly on the two actors and then the four actors. they do it so well, the script is absolutely amazing, the direction is fantastic, it really doesn't try to be more than it is and it's totally charming and you can watch it a million times.
can you say a little more about that please?
sure. some of the best movies ever made are fantastic, but you don't always want to watch them over and over and over again. when harry met sally is the kind of movie that is fantastic, and as a romantic comedy, a little more approachable, a little more likable, and it's something you can watch many many times over the years. i've seen that more times than i can count, and even though i know what's going to happen, it's enjoyable every time.
thank you for another most insightful critique. have a nice weekend.

so, what kind of movies do you like?
i really like comedy movies.
what do you like about comedy movies?

i like both.
is there any particular movie that you've liked a lot?
i really like the other guys.
what did you like about this movie?
i like the two actors. the two main actors were very funny and just gelled together well. i liked the plot was funny. it just had a funny vibe going through it and just the way everything happened just really bounced off and jelled well together.
nice. how about the kind of movies that you don't like, can you tell me more about them?

thank you for your feedback. enjoy your evening.
you, too.
what type of movies do you enjoy?
i like all kinds, but i really like the the superhero movies, especially the marvel universe ones. i like them because they have they seem to always really get get really good actors, and i just like comic books in general, and then the themes that the they use in the movies, and the production value of them is generally top notch, especially the marvel ones.
is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
i really like the the iron man ones, the very first one especially, and the second one was really good. but i guess right now probably the avengers. that series is just really good. the last one wasn't quite as good as the first two, but i hear good things about the second one, or the next one that's coming out, so i can't wait to see that one.
are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?
i am not a big horror fan. lot of people like that like the purge movies or i don't know, the house on haunted hill. i can't really think of a lot of the names cuz to me, they all just kind of sound the same, but it's not to say i won't watch one, but i just don't actively it'd probably be more one that i would maybe rent at rent at redbox or watch at netflix. it's not something that i would go be waiting on a friday night
is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?
no, not really a specific movie. generally, if i don't like something, i just don't watch it. so i would have to to really dislike something, i would have to watch it all the way through. to me, if it's not if it's not any good in the first 15 or 20 minutes, i'll just stop watching or do something else. and i'm generally pretty good the movies that i go to the movies to see you know, i try to make sure that they're going to be really good and worth
worth watching before, so i don't have to like walk out of the movies or anything. but if it's something that i've rented or try to watch on netflix it's no good, after about 10 to 15 minutes, i'll just switch.
have you seen black panther
yeah, i have some. that one was really good. i'll probably put that on my list of the best of the modern series.
what did you enjoy or not enjoy about this movie?
i just enjoyed pretty much everything. i liked the story. it was neat the way they did it. i've never i was never a black panther comic book fan. i don't even think i might have one maybe with him in it, but i think it was with him and somebody else. but so it's not like a comic book character that i thought i wasn't sure if i would enjoy the movie, but it was very surprising cuz it was probably one of the best the best marvel movies they've done so far,
clear with the very first time iron man.
thank you for your help and have a wonderful day!
what types of movies do you usually see?
i usually see comedies, action movies, superhero movies, teen movies, occasionally dramas or suspense movies.
ok. tell me one of your favorite movies.
the pretty pretty woman is one of my favorite movies.
great. why did you like it?
pretty woman is sort of a i think it gets billed as a romantic comedy, but it's much more of a romantic comedy drama. it has a lot of dramatic points to it. the pairing of julia roberts and richard gere is pitch-perfect, and it's one of the best pairings to like every grace the big screen. so the writing on the movie is fantastic.
the interactions between the characters especially julia and richard are what really make the movie and it's it's a wonderful it's a funny endearing movie.
alright. can you name a bad movie?
sure. the ugly truth is a bad movie.
what was so bad about it?
where to begin? it was billed as a like when it was promoted on commercials and start it was builled as a romantic comedy. it is not. it is it all it has a star of a man and a woman who were supposedly supposed to be in a romance . it's more of a gross out comedy, sort of a shock comedy. it had gross out humor. it had a lot of
rudeness and juvenile behavior. it was really bizarre what they were going for. i usually like katherine heigl, this was not a good movie. and her co-star in it, gerard butler, he is highly overrated. i don't know how he keeps getting these starring roles.
got it. have you seen bridesmaids?
yes, i have.
ok. what did you like about it?
bridesmaids is a great movie, funny, really well written, really well acted, and it's a little more original. it's sort of a but had a lot of laugh out loud humor and it had little more shocking humor at times, a little more
graphic humor at times but with a female leading cast and that's being extremely rare in movies. so, it was a really refreshing movie but just a really a very funny one.
okay, so have you seen searching?
no, i don't think so.
no, i haven't seen it.
how about skyscraper?
i think that might be a recent one maybe with the rock. i have not seen that.
do you plan to see it?
that's the one that i would watch if it came on tv, yeah, i would i would watch that one. it's i think it's just it's just like a general action movie like sort of action adventure. so, yeah, that one i'd watch.
okay, how about nocturnal animals?
oh god, no.
why not?
if i remember correctly, that is one of two things. that is either a scarier movie or a sort of a dramatic movie that has extremely that has a lot of darkness to it, sort of like verging on being a quentin tarantino movie. so probably something i'm not going to watch. it would have to be like an oscar contending me for me to want to see that kind of a movie.
so you don't like that type of movie?
it's not my favorite. it doesn't mean i'll never i wouldn't i wouldn't watch it but it would have to be get like excellent reviews. it would have to be considered, you know, really critically acclaimed for me to probably watch a movie like that.
okay. thank you for your time.
you're welcome.
what kinds of movies do you like?
i like animated movies.
well, tell me why do you like animated movies?
it reminds me of childhood and keep me happy. it makes me believe in the impossible.
how about a movie you liked?
the incredibles 2.
alright, why did you like that movie?
i thought it was very funny, but also centralized on the importance of family.
which i thought was beautiful.
interesting, is there a movie you did not like?
i do not like
million dollar baby
oh, why not?
i didn't think it was authentic or real to the female experience of what it's like to be a boxer.
ok, then have you seen the movie the lion king
yeah.
what is it about this kinds of movies that you like or dislike?
i like the fairy taleness of the lion king. i didn't like how he died, but you know i like the story in general about family.
wonderful. thank you for sharing. good bye.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like a lot of action movies. and sometimes animation if they fit right with my personal liking.
what do you like about these kinds of movies?
animation you could do a whole bunch of stuff that you cannot do with live action. sometimes cgi is never the best option and the best way to go about like impossible stuff is do it in animation because the idea's limitless on what you can do.
can you name a movie that you really liked?
last movie i really liked was justice league.
what did you like about this movie?
even though they give bad stuff about the bad cgi in the movie, it's still a guilty pleasure of mine. i'm a real dc fan even though marvel is good, but i still enjoy dc a lot more cuz their heroes and are a lot more and have more character to them. it was great seeing batman played by ben affleck be pretty great. superman was really good.
wonder woman was enjoyable, and the introduction of aquaman and cyborg and flash really made the movie interesting to watch. especially aquaman with his funny quotes here and there.
nice, what kind of movies do you dislike?
i don't like horror movies at all. they're not my go to at all, i wouldn't watch one.
what do you dislike about them?
i just don't like scary things in general. one, they give me nightmares sometimes. and i don't really like having nightmares because
i sometimes forget they're dreams and cuz they like look so real sometimes.
and probably like the realism of horror movies is what gets me. cuz there are sometimes like i feel like when i'm home alone, something might happen to me when i don't want it to.
can you name a movie that you didn't like?
last movie i did not like was i'm trying to remember.
hm.
i did not like x-men: days of future past at all.
what did you dislike about it?
i just didn't like the reboot of the x-men. i think if they wanted to do more with the x-men, they should've just went forward and ignored the first three first three movies, and added onto it with original characters like wolverines, cyclops, patrick stewart as the professor.
but yeah, i still like the move of making a brand-new trilogy for the x-men. that's about it.
cool! have you seen inside out?
no, i have not seen inside out. but i i have that on the list of what i want to watch.
ok, how about bohemian rhapsody?
i have not seen it. but i want to see it because my uncle is a huge queen fan. well, not huge, but he likes listening to queen. and i am, too. and i would like to learn more about queen because i wasn't born in that era or born in the era. or know know what happened.
what those what that group?
what sort of movies to you like?
i like westerns like the magnificent seven magnificent seven, sorry. action movies sort of like dredd or
lethal weapon. i'm not into like movies like terminator, which is kind of too not my style. i do like star wars and interstellar a lot, though.
what was the last movie you watched?
the last movie i watched was magnificent 7.
it was a pretty good movie, and i loved it.
what did you like about it most?
it had the right amount of action. it had right amount of comedy from chris pratt. the accuracy they chose for the film were amazing. they had a villan that you really would love to hear. the director was pretty good. i enjoyed most of what the director made which was like southpaw or training day.
and i really did enjoy the western vibe that was which was the main setting of the story.
what do you check for when picking a movie?
i check length, run time of the movie. sometimes i like to watch a long movie, maybe 2 hours or 2 hours and 30 minutes. sometimes a shorter movie, like an hour 30. if i wanted
probably wanted to watch action if i was in that kind of a mood, or if i was wanting to catch up on a superhero movie, or watch that instead.
thank you. good bye.
thank you.
hello, can you please name one of your favourite movie?
yeah. i guess probably recently, it would be
black panther
what is it about this type of movie that you like?
i like the superhero genre. this maybe in particular was a little bit different. it kind of dealt into the character a little more and wasn't wasn't just a you know wasn't just a superhero movie. it had a lot more to it, and it was a character that i didn't know a lot about, and start was kind of surprising and new to me.
ok. now. could you tell the name of a movie that you dislike?
pretty much any horror movie. i'd say or maybe like a quiet place was the only one i can really think of cuz to be honest, when i see horror movies' advertisements, i just usually kind of tune them out. but that one just seems kind of dumb to me. it was a world where you had to be completely quiet, otherwise the monsters were going to get you. it just didn't seem very realistic.
what is it about this type of movie that you dislike?
i'm just not a fan i mean they don't scare me and i'm just not a it's just not my cup of tea. and plus it seems like they come out with one every every couple of weeks there is a different hurt you know, some kind of different take on horror movies from old and then they start
i'll take a good, old drama or a superhero movie any day.
have you watched the movie bridesmaids ?
yeah, i've seen that.
it's pretty good.
did you like it
yeah, it was funny.
i'm surprised they haven't come out with another one yet.
what is it about this kind of movie that you like the most
generally if the acting's good and it's funny, you know, movies like that, kind of like the hangover, road trip.
no, they're funny. enjoyable you don't really have to think that much about them, and you can just go and laugh and lie down.
just not have to think, have a good time.
alright. have you watched the movie jason bourne ?
yeah, i've seen those. the first couple. i didn't really stick with it.
after the second one, where they killed his wife off, and they didn't do that at all in the books, i kind of stopped watching them. i might go back and watch them though, because it's been a while and i've reread the books since then, too. but i generally like that kind of movie, and it was a good movie. but it just ventured so far away from the books, and at the time, i had just finished reading the books when they came out, so after
well they killed her off early in the second movie and you know, in the book she really she stays on till the newer books came out. i don't know, it just kind of turned me off to them a little bit
but i would definitely be up to going back and watching them now.
alright. thank you for the information.

hi.
do you like movies like star wars?
i love star wars. i even like the new ones. i don't care what anybody says. the last jedi was pretty good, and the one before it was even even better. and i even like the han solo story, although it was kind of slow but i'll tell you, the one that was really good to me was the the rogue one. i really really enjoyed that one. i can't wait till the next one comes out.
solo was pretty good! there are some great theories about the last jedi. what do you like about these type of movies?
just the story. i saw the first star wars when i was
and it still makes going to the movies fun, kind of brings you back to that time when you were a little kid and you know you might get to go to the movies once every couple months.
that's pretty interesting. are there any other movies in this genre that you like? dare i ask, star trek?
yeah, i like star trek. i recently watched went back and watched all the different tv series and then went and watched all the different tv or all the different movies. and i'm not a super big fun of the first ones although the movies for the first ones were probably the best of the series, but i'm not a big fun of the first series. i try to watch it, re-watch it there's the first 3 seasons, and it was hard it was hard to get through it just because that is the acting's so bad 
and the stars were so bad, but i like all the movies. the movies i haven't found a movie i didn't like in the star wars series. although there was that one that was not quite as good as the rest, but star trek's good. i could go for another star trek movie.

what about that movie did u like?
it's just very interesting overall.
what about a movie u didn't like?
movies i didn't like there are so many movies that are bad, you know, the the acting is terrible, it doesn't keep your interest. you just want to turn it off. just poor poor acting, very cheaply image movies
is there a movie that fits that description u can name for me
there is a movie like this movie called super buddies. i mean, i like animals and stuff, but this movie was just stupid and silly.
what qualities specifically didn't u like about it?
it just was really a silly plot. didn't keep my interest. it was not what i thought it was going to be. you know, it was kind of silly.
thanks so much for sharing. going on a bit of a tangent, have u watched titanic
oh, yeah. i've seen titanic. i seen it a long time ago.
did u like it
yeah, i like titanic. you know, it was based on real events and i thought the acting was great. i really liked it.
what qualities of the movie did u like, aside from the acting
well, i thought it was believable. it made me sad. i felt emotional after watching it so it really had an impact on me.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like a good action movie.
like mission impossible?
love that series the the latest one, fallout, is one one of the best action movies, i think, ever.
what did you like about it
well like i think most people probably, the stunts and how real they looked and knowing that tom cruise actually did them was part of why they were so exciting.
what parts didn't you like?
of mission: impossible? well the stories are never that great. they're always kind of convoluted and hard to follow. but i thought the latest one was probably one of the better stories cuz it was pretty simple.
what movies do you stay away from?
oh. well as a genre, usually kind of rom com, romantic comedies.
i like comedies. and i don't mind the romantic things. i don't know. maybe it's just all those movies seem to be the same movie. but, i don't know. i just don't typically like them very much.
did you watch the hunger games series?
i saw the first one, and i think the second one, but i didn't finish it, no.
what did you dislike about the first one?
maybe cuz it wasn't rated r. i don't know. it seemed like the premise of it deserved or required a more violent or harsher take, a more adult, and i think it felt like they like pulled their punches a little bit, and it also seemed like a story i'd kind of seen before.
i don't know.
have you seen battle royale?
yes, i think there's multiple like sequels maybe of them. but i haven't seen those. i've seen the first one though, the original one that hunger games is compared to a lot of times.
what did you like about battle royale?
well, it kind of i guess hits that note of you know it's the premise is dark it's you know kids or school age kids killing each other and it actually shows the violence of that. so like if you are going to go with that premise, go with that premise all the away. don't don't try to mitigate it with like a pg 13 rating or something like go all in or don't go all.
i don't go at all, and i think that was probably the biggest difference in those two movies.
thank you for your input, have a great day

thank you for your feedback. good night.
good night.
what type of movies do you enjoy?
i really like romantic comedies. they're my favorite.
what appeals to you with these type of movies?
they are funny. usually a little lighthearted, usually has possibly heartwarming, has a happy ending, so it's nothing that will really get you down, and it's usually something that you'll leave feeling good after watching. they're also really easy to watch.
that's awesome
is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
yeah, while you were sleeping is one of my favorites.
what did you like about this movie?
it was an unexpected delight. it is extremely well acted and well written, but it's it's sort of an untraditional. it's not a traditional romantic comedy. it is sort of a romantic comedy paired with a family comedy, and it really works, but it's it's it's very endearing.
it's nice to see movies not follow a formula and go out of the box
yes, very true.
are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?
i'm not the biggest fan of scary movies.
what about these movies is unappealing?
i just don't enjoy being scared. it could it can cause me to have nightmares, so in order to actually watch a scary movie, i have to sort of remind myself that it's fake, which sort of takes away the point of watching it in the first place, so i usually just avoid them.
i can definitely understand that
is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?
if that's a horror film
like alien is a great movie, but not one i could ever watch.
what do you dislike about this movie?
that'll give me nightmares.
it has literally things that will give me nightmares. like the pictures from it, i've watched a few minutes here and there, and it is it's so disgusting and definitely things that i would somehow work into my dreams that would turn into nightmares. so despite it being well acted and one of sigourney weaver's best movies ever, i just can't.
have you seen the movie crazy rich asians?
yeah, that's a great movie.
what did you like or dislike about this title?
first of all its great because it has a cast that's asian which is very unusual for a romantic comedy. its unusual in general for a hollywood movie but its even unusual for a romantic comedy. so it was nice a nice change and still kind of like an ordinary romantic comedy story, so it really worked, very funny, very good cast, and i'm looking forward to the sequel.
thank you for your time and have a great day! bye!
what kind of movies do you enjoy and why?
some of my favorites are romantic comedies.
is there a particular film you enjoy?
yes. i love you've got mail.
what did you like about that kind of film?
the cast is fantastic, the writing is superb, and it's just very heartwarming but also very funny and obviously there is romance. the supporting cast is really good and adds to the overall film, so it's just not about the romance. every part of it actually works including the parts where they're not together and it's not about them, it's more about the businesses that are competing. so, the whole movie is great but it's something
you can watch over and over again.
is there a particular movie you don't enjoy?
the ugly truth is that movie i really don't like that's like a romantic comedy i don't like.
what didn't you like about that kind of film?
it was it's billed as a romantic comedy, but it's really more of a, i don't know, shock comedy or gross-out comedy. it is not endearing, not funny. it's sort of bizarre and crass. the humor is much more juvenile than what should be in a romantic comedy. it just didn't work all the way around. i usually like katherine heigl's movies, but that was a bust.
have you heard about the movie deadpool?
yes.
have you watched the movie before?
i have.
what did you like about that kind of movie?
i really like superhero movies which deadpool is one, but this is a different one where there is a lot of focus on comedy and the writing is very important because there is such a focus on comedy and, so it's different but it really works. it's a very entertaining and a very atypical for a superhero movie and ryan reynolds is just great in it.
ok
tell me what type of movies you like.
i really like comedies and science fiction movies.
perfect! now, what would be one of your favorite movies?
i recently watched a movie called sorry to bother you, and i really enjoyed it.
got it. could you give me some reasons you enjoy that type of movie?
i thought like it was very different and doesn't fall like the normal script and was very funny and interesting to watch.
ok thanks. how about a movie you really didn't like?
a movie recently that i haven't didn't didn't like was ant-man and the wasp. it wasn't the greatest movie.
alright. and, what are some things you really don't like about that type of movie?
i felt like the movie was very predictable and followed like a script that all kinds of superhero movies have which i didn't enjoy that much because it wasn't very different from what i usually watch.
how about the movie mamma mia what do you think about that one?
i've never watched it, but i don't typically watch musicals, so i don't think i would like it that much.
ok and one more
one more
how about crazy rich asians ?
i haven't watched that movie but i think that i would enjoy it a lot and i look forward to watching in the future.
ok great
anything else about that type of movie you like?
no, that's all.
thanks for you time
thank you.
what type of movies do you like?
i like like constantine, and i like a lot of disney movies, too.
any particular disney movie you like?

i think one of my favorite movies was moana. it was it was really good.
what did you like about moana?
it was just really nice to watch it. i thought it was a really good movie.
can you name me a movie you didn't like?
movie i didn't like i think the
the incredibles 2 wasn't really that good.
did you think it was overhyped too?
yeah, i did actually.
anything else you didn't like about it?
i just felt like the story was really bland.
have you heard of the movie maze runner?
no, i haven't. i've heard of it, but i've never seen it.
what about the dark knight?
oh, the dark knight. i've watched it a long time ago but i think it was a pretty good movie.
can you remember what you liked about it?
i think it was the setting, like i really like batman, so you know, batman's just really cool. so i thought it was a pretty interesting movie.
okay. thank you
what type of movies do you enjoy?
i like dramas and thrillers.
what appeals to you with these type of movies?
they're just they usually have interesting stories and they keep you guessing as to what's going to happen. it's they're usually not very boring. so, you're never finding yourself like falling asleep or thinking about other stuff during the movie. you're constantly engaged with it.
is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
reservoir dogs is kind of a drama/thriller, so i would consider that one.
what did you like about this movie?
the story's just really well told, and it's interesting, like it and it's told in a unique way, where it's kind of flashbacks and flash forwards and just overall, the story's really neat, cuz bank heists are cool, but it's more it's about a bank heist like after it. you don't even see the bank heist, so it's just a neat way to tell the story.
are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?
i'm not a big fan of action movies.
what about these movies is unappealing?
they're just kind of boring and mindless. i mean, i like them every once in a while, but they all just make you feel like an hour and a half of just the same thing over and over of action scenes and things blowing up which is cool for a while, but they get boring pretty fast.
is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?
not an action movie, but i didn't like twilight movies. which i only saw two of them, but i doubt the other ones are any better.
what do you dislike about this movie?
the acting was terrible. the story wasn't interesting. i don't know. nothing grabbed me about it. i was bored the whole time.
have you seen bohemian rhapsody
nope.
have you seen the shawshank redemption
yes, i have. it's a good movie.
what did you enjoy or not enjoy about this movie?
prison movies in general which is kind of good. although maybe i just think that because i really like shawshank but the story is really interesting, and just the characters are really good in that movie. and seeing how they develop over time which is really good movie.
what kind of movies to you like, and why do you like this type of movie?
i like comedy movies like adam sandler movies. i like the waterboy. i like happy gilmore.
can you name a particular movie that you like?
i like the waterboy because he makes me laugh, it's it's a feel good story. it's for good versus evil, conquering your fears.
can you name a movie that you do not like?
i did not like
project x i just it was it didn't have much of a plot, just just just a bunch of people running around. it didn't really
the characters were there there wasn't any character building type of thing. the characters just were like doing anything.
do you like the movie halloween ?
yeah. i like that movie. i like scary movies.
what do you like about this movie? please give me 2 reasons.
i like that people get murdered.
i like i like the gruesome scenes people get murdered the scary sounds in the back of the movie.

no, i have never seen that movie.
have you heard of this movie?

i've never heard of that movie.

i never seen that movie. i've i've i've seen a harry porter movie but not that not that one.
have you heard of this movie?
i might have heard of that movie from sometime ago, but i've never seen it.
what type of movies do you enjoy?
i like most movies, but i especially like movies that are based on true stories.
why do you enjoy those types of movies?
i think it's easier to get interested in them and to feel more involved cuz you know it happened, or at least it's based on something that happened, so it feels more real, as opposed to a fictional story.
i can definitely understand that, is there a specific film you enjoy?
the most recent one i watched was moneyball. that was really good. it's a baseball movie.
what did you enjoy about it?
i like at least right now i like baseball cuz it's playoff times and i'm enjoying that, but it's also just an interesting story. it has brad pitt and jonah hill and it's just well acted and a really interesting story.
are there any type of movies that you dislike?
i don't really like romantic comedies that much.
is there a specific reason why?
they just all feel the same to me. they just they're not very enjoyable, and they all feel they're telling the same story but with different actors. they're very cliched.
is there a particular movie that you dislike?
a particular movie the worst movie i ever saw was the adventures of pluto nash. nothing can be worse than that.
why is that the worst movie to you?
cuz it's meant to be a comedy but it's not funny at all. like saw it as a kid and i didn't laugh once.

i've seen ready player one.

i mean, a lot of the a lot of the visuals were pretty incredible in that, and i thought it was neat how you know, it's like like the type of movie i would have really wanted to see if i was like 13 or 14, it would have been
a lot of fun to see it at that age.
and what was disappointing about it?

thank you for your input, have a great day
you, too.
what kinds of movies do you typically enjoy?
typically, i enjoy comedy movies.
why do you like comedies?
they're a nice little break from everyday, ordinary life. and they incite laughter, which is always a good thing. definitely something i don't normally do throughout a day. not unless i seek out funny things.
i see. and what about funny things is attractive to you in films?
well
it feels like it gives the movie more substance.
without adding an artificially complex story or without
okay. that makes sense. so what's a movie you've seen that you've enjoyed
i'd say shallow hal was a good movie, i like that movie.
oh what's it about? i've never heard of it.
well, it's about a guy who is shallow beyond belief, who is not a very particularly attractive, okay, jack black is the star of the movie or at least you know he's the guy who is playing the portrayed hal who was very shallow and
he runs across a guru motivational speaker whatever who basically changes his perception on the way that woman look and and then yeah. he essentially goes after by and large physically unattractive women
as a consequence
i see. and what kinds of movies do you tend to dislike or avoid?
i usually dislike drama movies just cuz i'm not i've had enough drama in my life that i don't really care to seek out more drama, even if it's fictionalized.
i see. so have you seen any movies that you disliked before?
i have, but none that i can think of currently.

i like comedy movies.
well, tell me why do you like comedy movies?
because they make me laugh.

and he fall in love with a woman. his friend his friend does and
they play pranks on each other to get the woman to like one of them more than the other.
and deals with crime
the plot is interesting.
interesting, is there a movie you do not like?
i did not like sex and the city the movie.
oh, why not?
yeah, because there was too much it was just too much girly things in the movie.
the the movie didn't really appeal to me because there was just too much girls talking about girl topics and stuff like that.
ok, then have you seen the movie logan
no, i haven't seen that movie.
ok, then have you seen the movie the matrix
yes, i haven't seen that movie. i like keanu reeves.

why do you like actions movies?
they're fun to watch. they keep you keep you excited. there's not really too many lulls in action movies.

it had an interesting take on the whole superhero movie you know, it's just a good watch.
well, is there a movie you did not like?

bye-bye.
tell me what types of movies you like.
lately i've been interested in foreign films, particularly ones that come out of japan.
got it. could you give me some reasons you enjoy that type of movie?
i really like the action movies that have come out of there in the last 10 or 20 years.
ok thanks. how about a movie you really didn't like?
a movie i really didn't like from japan? i can't really think of anything. not really from japan, but i thought the godzilla movie could have been a little better.
alright. and, what are some things you really don't like about that type of movie?
oh, i just thought that the plot was kind of weak. and, so, yeah, that was my only complaint about it really.
so would you enjoy a movie like wonder woman ?
oh, yeah. definitely.
and again, it'd be great to hear why you enjoy that type of movie
i like wonder woman because i like to see female superheroes. you don't see enough of those, i think. and i've always liked wonder woman, watched the tv show when i was a kid, so there's the nostalgia factor.
great. let's chat about one more movie. how about red sparrow ?
okay. red sparrow, yeah. i love jennifer lawrence, and i think she saved that movie from being a total dud, but again, the script, the writing, and even the directing just is kind of shallow. but jennifer lawrence was awesome.
what kind of movies to you like, and why do you like this type of movie?
my favorite type of movie is the avengers because it has a lot of action, and it's a superhero movies movie. and i love superheros, and i think it's my favorite kind of movie in the world. and i think it's really exciting. it's really exciting, and it's a very popular movie. and it has all sort of cool characters in there, with cool magical powers and abilities. and i think it's the kind of movie
is really exciting.

yeah, the avengers.
the avengers has a new movie coming out called endgame, which is the final part of the avengers. it's part 4 of the movie.

i agree. matt damon makes those movies.
yeah, he sure does and he does a good job doing it.
did you like the matrix movies?
i did watch the matrix movies from the beginning to the end, good movies. i don't think i'd watch them again but they were good scifi movies.
thank you so much for your input.
what type of movies do you enjoy?
well, i really enjoy romance films. i think romance films are just all right, you know. and it's fair to say that romance films are probably my favorite category of film. i love the plot, i love you know the the acting. and and a lot of times the acting has to be a lot better in these romance films you'll find. at least in my opinion because the actions doesn't drive it like it does in action movies.
is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
yeah. yeah, i love i don't know if you can call it a romance film, but if you if you've ever seen it, the 40-year-old virgin. really really funny film. and i was surprised when i first saw it, too. i didn't think it would have been that funny.
but it was really really funny and the romance in it is pretty good. yeah, you would be surprised about those. i mean you would really be surprised.
definitely a funny film, really helped steve carrell's career
oh, totally. totally totally.
are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?
i don't like
yeah, i don't like honestly, i don't like bad movies with bad critical reviews. you know, just in general. i would say as like a specific kind of movie, i don't like those like lifetime movies. i don't know what you would even call them, but they're just like they're made for tv, and i totally understand some people do like them, but i'm just not one of those kinds of people. i think that lifetime movies just kind of stink, generally. i wouldn't advise anyone to
what deters you away from these movies?
just the script, the plot, the shooting, it's all it's all sort of an amalgamation
is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?
well, let me turn on lifetime channel now dude. i mean i'm sure anything on there is just going to be absolutely absolutely garbage. i did watch one movie on there. well i don't remember what was on there maybe it was on oprah's network. or maybe it wasn't in on there maybe it was in bc, kind of liked it. that one was about this teacher with turrets how like a student wanted to swith out a process cuz he had turrets and that one was kind of touching
yeah, just just generally like anything on lifetime is probably here, here, my christmas inn. that's what's playing right, and i'm sure that one's probably not astounding.
to say the least.
have you seen o brother where art thou
i oh, yeah yeah, i did. is that i watched that for a film and music class in my college. all right, perfect perfect. that movie i remember i remember the boat, right? they had a boat?
they had a boat in sail in the swamp. okay i remember that, i'm definitely definitely getting vibes from that movie. i remember the end of the movie as well where they had the hanging scene, that was really powerful. i mean that was pretty powerful a little but i didn't it didn't strike me like something that would stick with me the way it did when i first saw it.
thank you for your help and have a wonderful day!
no, thank you.
what are some type of movie genres that you like?
i like comic book movies, i like dramatic movies.
i like suspenseful movies.
why is it that you like suspenseful movies?
i like the feeling of not knowing what's about to happen.
what is one of your favorite movies?
braveheart.
why?
it was an excellent story. and when it came out, the scenes between the scottish and the british fighting in the field were just amazingly well shot. it was beautiful to watch.
i think it was sad how his wife died
that was brutal.
what type of movies do you not like?
i don't like
i don't like horror movies or scary movies. not because i think that they're scary but because they all seem to go for the cheap scare.
the loud noise that makes you jump in your seat kind of thing.
oh, that's true
have you heard of the movie interstellar?
i have heard of that. i've seen that movie.
what did you like about this kind of movie? .
i like science fiction. i always have ever since i was a kid and this was a very well done example of that genre.
have you seen the movie die hard?
of course i have
just making sure
what did you like about this kind of movie?
i like die hard because it was the first time i remember seeing an action movie where the hero wasn't some gigantic muscle-bound guy. you know, he was just some regular dude that got put in a tough spot and came through.
okay. thank you
what kind of movies do you like?
i like comedy movies.
what do you like about comedy movies?
well, they're an escape from reality usually and they make me laugh.
i see. so you like something with a little humor
yes.
is there any particular movie that you've liked a lot?
i like the movie joe somebody. it was kind of quirky, you know, wasn't like overly funny, had a story to it. but it was also, you know, pretty light-hearted. also, tim allen.
nice, so you like movies with famous comedians?
i mean, yes but it's it really depends on who it is. like tim allan was kind of a seminal part of my childhood, so i think that's why kind of enjoyed him and he's funny but.
okay. how about movies that you don't like? can you describe them for me?
i don't really care much for drama cuz, well
i look to movies to escape from reality and my problems. and watching drama movies is like, i don't know, escaping to another iteration of my existence. i don't want more drama.
i want less of it.
so you don't like serious movies?
i like serious movies it's just like

a time to kill

was the movie better than the book?
no, the movie is never better than the book.

have you seen the movie lord of the rings?
no.
what about home alone?
yes.
what did you like about this kind of movie?
i saw home alone when i was a child and i thought it was quite funny. at i watch a little bit of comedy sometimes, i just don't like that stupid comedy. i like more intelligent comedy.
such as?
i don't know. just something not like dumb and dumber.
okay. thanks
what kinds of movies do you like?
i really like romantic comedies.
why do you like romantic comedies?
they're fun. they're usually funny. they have a happy ending. they're more light-hearted in nature. and they're a nice escape.
alright , how about a movie you liked?
one of my favorites is when harry met sally.
why did you like that movie?
that has a exceptional cast that really works on just about all cylinders in every single scene, and the writing is exceptional. it is funny and poignant and touching. it just really works and you can rewatch that movie a million times and still want to see it again.
interesting, is there a movie you did not like?
the bounty hunter, that's not good.
why not?
that has an actor who seems to regularly get cast, but is largely miscast especially in romantic comedies. he sort of doesn't give give off the right kind of charm for this kind of movies. he doesn't pull off comedy well. he doesn't pull off sort of charming handsome pursuiter well either.
and it's not a good showing from the leading actress either, it's just a poor script and poor execution.
ok, then have you seen the movie mamma mia! here we go again
yes.
what is it about these kinds of movies that you like or dislike?
well, in general i do like sort of the nature of the movies light and fun and sort of based on music kind of a musical. that's not exactly musical but kind of a musical. those are the kinds of movies i do like. mamma mia! is not my favorite but that's cuz it's sort of silly and doesn't have a lot to hold it together but in general i do like that kind of movie.
tell me what type of movies you like.
i like action movies.
perfect! now, what would be one of your favorite movies?
bourne ultimatum
got it. could you give me some reasons you enjoy that type of movie?
sure. the action is non-stop. the pace of that particular movie is perfect. it just keeps going. it has a like perfect rhythm to it, even though it does technically slow down at parts. the way that the, sort of, movie soundtrack and everything works, from start to finish for like 3 hours, doesn't stop and, the acting and the writing of the movie is excellent.
so it's it's a it's easily one of my favorite movies ever.
ok thanks. how about a movie you really didn't like?
die hard 5, a good day to die hard, i think that was called.
alright. and, what are some things you really don't like about that type of movie?
what action movies, so technically i could have liked it and i basically loved everything else in the movie series but this fifth one it just really didn't use the lead character bruce willis as well and it had it was straining to have like subtitles. so, the story itself was not good but it was made more confusing by adding in subtitles to a series that didn't have them before.
and just sort of the way it played out was just pedestrian at best. so even though the technical action scenes were pretty decent, the entire movie, the story line wasn't very believable. it wasn't written all that well. it wasn't acted all that well. it just was a disappointment.
thanks! and, how about the movie the shape of water what do you think about that one?
although i haven't seen that one, the concept is not one that really appeals to me. i know enough about what the movie is and what it's about. the type of movie, like a drama, is fine, but the concept of that particular movie is not one that i'm likely to really enjoy a ton.
ok. and lastly, how about frozen?
frozen is a great movie.
what about that type of movie is great?
well it's a animated movie, so in general, it seems like it could be geared much more towards children. but frozen is a really well rounded, well written, well acted movie, so even though it is technically aimed at children, it's it's one that adults can easily enjoy and fall in love with. the music is great. the story line is endearing. it really works well.
great! thanks for your time!
see you later
sure. bye.
what kind of movies do you generally watch?
science fiction
what do you like about science fiction movies?
like the action and adventure and the characters are usually very interesting.

i really like avengers infinity wars.
what left a strong impression in that movie for you?
what happens to the hero when they did not win?
they disappeared.
what do you think happened to the heros?
i think they probably went off into another universe. they may come back later.
the idea that hero would return is very exciting is it not?
yes, it is. it's what i'm waiting for and hopefully the follow up series.
are there any particular movies you did not enjoy watching?
not really.
what about movies like jason x?
oh. you're right. i didn't like jason x.
what do you dislike the most about the movie?
oh, it was based on a character that died several times in previous movies, so there's no logic to it.
so the illogically part is the part you find displeasing to watch?
yes. movie has to make some sense, even though it's a fantasy movie. it has to have some logic to it.

can you give a couple of reasons why you like or dislike this kind of movie?

what is it about the story of this type of movie that you like?
i just like the superheroes, you know, like
thanos, actually. i don't really like the villains, but i like thanos. like he was a pretty cool character.
thank you for your feedback.
no problem.
what type of movies do you like?
i like good action movies like the fast and the furious movies, which aren't great movies, but they're fun movies. and so, fun action movies that don't take themselves seriously i like.
what is another one of your favorite movies?
another one in that genre or just overall?
overall
there was a
i won't say that one cuz it's too old, and i like it just for the music. but let's go with
i guess the matrix just because of how i compare most of the action movies i watch to the matrix, but i kind of consider it.
somewhat of a sci-fi movie more than action. but i don't know, it's kind of both.
what type of movies do you not like?
bad superhero movies like batman & robin. from the '90s, the schumacher ones. i feel like those type movies, they are more parody than
oh. well, another one is this speaking of parody movies, the scary movies, or the whatever the recent ones are. not the wayan brother scary movie, the first or second one, but the the more recent ones, which i think they may have quit making now thankfully. or the lampoon pop culture and movies, i don't they're not they don't write jokes. they're just they show you the reference, and that's it.
they're horrible.
that's true. they weren't even funny
nope. they failed at their most basic point of existence.
i don't think they were trying to be funny either. i i think they were just trying to cash in on the pop references in
have you seen the movie mission impossible?
the latest? it doesn't really matter. yeah, i've seen all of them. they're one of my favorite series. they just keep getting better and better.
which movie is your favorite?
in that series i guess probably the most recent one, the fallout. just cuz it has the most jaw dropping stunts throughout. and knowing that tom cruise actually did that stuff was i think made that film even better than
knowing that or thinking it was all cgi, which is another reason i like those movies, is that they use very little cgi.
have u seen the movie justice league?
yes, i did not like it.
what did you dislike about this kind of movie?
it was dark, but like visually dark. in the parts where it was trying to be funny, it wasn't funny. it felt like a movie from the '90s kind of like the batman robin which is and that's the problem with all the dc stuff, is it? takes itself so seriously, but it it goes too far in trying to do that and imputes itself and
and they also i i understand they're trying to do that to set themselves apart from marvel, but i don't think they're being very successful. and justice league felt like it wasn't earned. they didn't set up these characters very well. the only character that anybody really likes in them is the wonder woman i guess superman to an extent, but the reason they tried to quickly cash in and catch up to marvel and i think it
shows in the final product it's it looks pretty mess.
okay. thanks

ok , have you seen the equalizer
no
ok, thank you for sharing
what type of movies do you like?
i really like action movies.
why do you like those movies?
i like the i like the action in them. i like the nonstop sort of rhythm to the movie. it sort of takes you out of reality, really immerses you into the movie. they usually are a lot of fun, although i do prefer the ones that aren't quite so violent, but in general, it's really a nice escape and a lot of fun.
what movie specifically do you like?
my favorite is probably bourne ultimatum.
why did you like this movie?
the cast is excellent, the writing is spectacular, and the execution is just flawless. it is like the most perfect action movie. it is just from start to finish. it's non-stop. it sort of doesn't give you a chance to breath as it sort of on it's quest for the main character jason bourne is on this quest to find out the truth and find justice. it's fantastic.
what type of movie did you dislike?
a movie that i disliked is a good day to die hard, that was not a good action movie.
why did you not like this movie?
well, this is part of a series of movies the die hard movies. and this particular one is by far the worst. and it's really the worst because it sort of lost sight of what's it's supposed to be which is about bruce willis as character. and this one was i mean, there was so much boring talk, there was subtitles.
the action like the special backs that they did were good, but the story line was terrible and it just as i mean, it just was so bad. it was it was so disappointing i guess because the other movies in the series are so good and this one really didn't leave up to what the rest of the series has been.
have you seen mission impossible?
i love mission impossible. yes.
what did you like or dislike about this movie?
i love mission: impossible. it's easily one of my all time favorites in terms of my favorite series of action movies mission: impossible is it. the tom cruise really shepherds the entire series very well and each movie very well. it has sort of innovative action that you just don't see in every movie which is great. so, it's sort of it really is a movie onto itself you're not going to get what you get when you go to see a mission
possible in other movies and even though the cast can change from movie to movie, it's all really worked and i think it's because the they really get a good storyline, a good writer and every single mission: impossible movie has had a great director.

alright, and what about those do you dislike?
usually it's it has to do with the plot. they're just you know, documentaries seem to be really cookie cutter. they they kind of all seem to follow the same format, and it gets really boring after a while.
i see. so they lack the element of surprise, which is what you enjoy.
yeah, i mean i yeah. i don't like it if it's too predictable, definitely. yeah. so i like i like things to be a little bit more dynamic.

ant-man i did see ant-man. i thought it was okay. i thought it could have been better though. i like paul rudd, but yeah, that one that one wasn't wasn't the best. it wasn't bad though. i thought it was i thought it was just okay.
what would you have liked to be different about that movie?
you know, i'm not sure. i just i thought it was trying to be a little bit too funny as opposed to being more like a action adventure movie.
i see. have you seen any of the jason bourne movies?
i have seen quite a few of them, i believe. maybe all of them. i don't i'm not sure. i can't remember if i've seen them all, but i've seen most of them, at least.

oh, those are really cool. definitely the first one is really good. i i really like the i really like the, you know, the disoriented. the whole disoriented spy thing is really cool to me.

one of my favorites. how about eight crazy nights?
what is it about?
eight crazy nights is about i believe adam sandler is like depressed cuz he his parents died in a car accident when he was a kid, and so he like particularly the holidays for whatever reason. i can't remember.
and yeah, it just kind of follows through him going from being a grouchy asshole about the holidays to liking them and being a liked person.
oh, okay. i'm guessing it's very funny?
it is pretty funny.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you like?
well, for one, i like that it was animated cuz well yeah, i just like animated movies usually. i also like that it was just funny.

i've never watched that either, honestly.

i just you know what, i got enough drama in my own life. i don't need more through a movie.
hahaha. that's true
okay. thank you.
yeah.
what type of movies do you enjoy?
i like sci-fi movies quite a bit.
what do you enjoy about them?
it's an interesting take on the future and kind of seeing what people think the future will be like and it's just neat to see how people's brains were able to come up with ideas that might be realistic.
i can definitely see why people would be interested in that especially with that imaginative aspect
what movie from that genre do you enjoy?
i haven't seen it in a while but i really liked gattaca.
what did you like about that movie?
it's sci fi, but it's realistic sci fi in that it feels like it could actually happen in the future, and it's just an interesting story, and that's why i like it.
that is awesome
are there any type of movies that you dislike?
i'm not a big fan of comic book movies.
what don't you like about them?
there are just too many of them that i feel so far behind that i don't want to have to catch up on all the ones i've missed. so when i do finally sit down and watch one, it feels like what's the point? because there's like 50 others i haven't seen, so it feels hard to get invested.
i can see that, their definitely has been a huge increases in those movies
is there a particular movie that you dislike?
disney's dinosaur, i think it was disney, that they made back in the '90s was terrible.
what don't you like about them?
i don't really remember much about the movie cuz i was like seven or six when i saw, but i remember even the kid i was sitting on the theater wanted to walk out just cuz it was so boring. nothing was interesting.
i don't blame you for wanting to walk out since it was boring.
have you seen jason bourne?
no, the latest one, yeah.
what did you like or dislike about this movie?
i like that it was a a bourne movie, but i didn't like that it didn't really feel like a bourne movie. it felt too actiony to be a bourne movie.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like movies with a really intricate plot, something like with great acting, and something with a lot of adventure and mystery.
nice, can you name a movie that you enjoyed a lot?
i really like like the movie a star is born.
what did you like about it?
i like the plot, and i like the story line. and i really like the acting and the music.
nice. how about the kind of movies that you dislike?
i really dislike movies that are have poor acting and silly plots that don't make any sense and and just, you know
movies that just don't make any sense and are just bad overall.
can you name a movie that you didn't like?
i really hated this movie airborne.
it just made no sense, and it was really bad.
was the acting bad too?
yes, the acting was terrible.
have you seen inception?
i have not seen inception.
how about birdbox?
i have not seen bird box, but i would like to see it. i heard it was pretty good.
what types of movies do u enjoy
i really love action movies.
can u name an action movie that u really liked?
one movie i really loved was venom.
what qualities about venom did u enjoy?
i liked that it had a sci-fi spin on it, and i also loved the acting and the short stints of comedy in it that really stood out.
is there an action movie that didn't peak your interest?
there's been a lot over the years, but one of the big ones that i didn't really like the first time i watched it was john wick.
what about john wick didn't u like?
i felt that the story wasn't developed that well. it was just too heavy of action which resulted in the movie not appealing to me the first time i watched it.
thanks for sharing. have u watched the movie guardians of the galaxy
yes, i have.
did u like this kind of movie?
yes, i loved it.
why is that?
i love most of the marvel movies, but i also liked guardians of the galaxy because it was funny, it did have strong action, and the actors really acted well in it.
what kind of films do you like to see?
i really like action movies.
why do you like action movies?
they're a great escape. you are almost never thinking about much else besides the movie you're watching, kind of nonstop from start to finish, and they're usually a lot of fun. the action is a lot of fun. a lot of times, the storylines are either fun or intriguing, and all the better if the acting is good, and the action movies can sort of go
both ways with acting, but usually there's enough action to carry things through if the acting's not there.
great, that's really good to know. now what's a movie you've seen recently that you enjoyed?
recently
black panther
that's a fun one, did you like it?
i loved it.
why?
it's very high quality action. it is very a lot of fun, actually very inspiring. the story is great, sometimes that suffers in this kind of movie, but this one, the story is great. it's very exciting, and it really is it's a very full complete movie. so, you really get a lot of great acting, great action
and it's just and it's also it really is a lot of fun.
that's wonderful. i"m glad you enjoyed it! now what kind of movies would you say you generally avoid?
i stay away from a lot of sci-fi movies.
why's that?
they can be good but a lot of them are high concept and the execution will be way off. and i watch a movie and try to understand it as opposed to sort of going with it and a good deal of the sci-fi don't make a lot of sense.
i see. that makes sense.
yes.
based on what you've said i'm curious if you've seen mission impossible fallout
yes.
what did you think of it?
i loved it. i love all the mission: impossible movies. it's probably my favorite franchise at this point and it was as good as the ones before and it is
always from start to finish. usually really well edited so that there is not a lot of extra going on that sort of distracts from the movie. the characters are engaging, and one's that pull you in even though there is always several who are new and unfamiliar to you it doesn't seem to matter. it' just each of the mission impossible picks up and introduces you to
you like them and you just go with the story. it's always great.
that sounds like a good time! i'm glad you have a series you love.
yes. i am, too.
so have you seen escape room?
no. that's a little scary for me.
would you ever consider seeing it?
yeah, like if my friends wanted to see it, i would go with them.
thank you. one last question for you
sure
so i know you avoid sci-fi, but you like action so i'm curious if you've seen guardians of the galaxy
i have not. that is
it i don't know, something about it seemed a little too busy, but people really love it, so i feel i'll i will see it at some point and i do like the marvel movies so i probably will see it at some point. but it does seem a little a little much, i might not love it the way everybody else does, but i i will give it a try.
what is your favorite movie?
oh god, there's so many.
that's a tough choice here. i would have to go with back to the future.
back to the future, ok all of them or just one of them
all of them, especially the first one. the first one is the one that i saw when i was growing up, so it really left a deep impression on me.
what is your favorite part of the movie? the setting or character or other
all the characters, actually. they have their own little quirks and their own little backgrounds and everything. so, that's very cool. and especially, well, all the sets, you know? it's it's built like a real place. so, it feels real, too, if that makes sense. like it's not like it's made up for the movie.
do you think they predicted the future well
yes, although we don't have flying cars yet. but we have self-driving ones.
would you like to have a flying car yourself
yes, it'd be very convenient until everybody has one and now the air spaces are too busy.
when do you think those might come out
oh, boy! we are looking maybe in the next 50 years. i know they are working on it but before it is publicly available, it is going to be a long time.
that would be for awhile, what about characters, who do you like the most in the movie
doc brown, the professor. he plays a really good character in these it just worked out really well the way that they cast him, and he's really into character. like it feels like he was made for the role.
the professor? can you relate well with him
yeah.
yeah, i like to tinker. not that i invent things, but it does speak to me.
ok if you like to invent things what would you like to invent or improve on
better way to get your power.
and if you think even back to the future, they had this little mini nuclear reactor for your house. that'd be awesome.
like alternative energy?
yes. solar power is nice but it's still limited on it's form depending on the area that you leave.
thats very innovative yes, what about a scene you didnt really enjoy from the movie
the scene that i really liked was the one where he eventually gets back like the the whole suspense to last, you know, 15 20 minutes when they are building up trying to get him back to his own time.
why do you like it
it's suspenseful. it pulls you into the movie. like the first time i saw it, i was on the ends of my seat and i was almost screaming at the screen, you know?
where did you watch it, in the theater?
no. i watched it at home. i wasn't old enough to go to the theater.
ah ok, that must have been very memorable scene as a child
yes. and it was a good movie to watch when we're young.
can you share with me some movies you just dont like
i hate sports movies. they just don't interest me, i think they're boring. if i wanted to watch something sports, i would watch it myself.
like i watch like real sports, not a sports movie.
ok there are many movies involving football players and tennis players, you are not interested in anyone of those?
if i have other options, then i would watch something else. if i had to pick, you know, if you go to movies, and you get to pick between three shows, then of those three movies and one of them is a sports movie, it's an automatic out.
ok have you seen one like match point for example
no.
how about other sports movies have you seen any
yeah, i've seen a few. i did enjoy rocky. the first couple of rocky movies were good. the blind side, which is a sports movie, but it's more a drama. and space jam, of course. everybody loves space jam.
the blind side and rocky would you say they are heavier on drama or the sports element
drama.
ok would that be a good reason why you are ok with them
i think so. yeah, i think that's a safe thing safe thing to say. the sports takes a background, with the drama to foreground.
what type of movies do you like?
i like movies that involve time travel of some kind.
why time travel?
because it makes for like interesting plot lines for like you know people go back to the past to change something in the present or to change something that's going on in the story.
what is one of your favorite movies?
one of my favorite movies is 12 monkeys.
why?
it's it kind of you know it deals with the with the hero who's trying to stop the apocalypse from happening by time traveling.
what type of movies do you not like?
i'm not a real big fan of romantic movies.
why not?
i just think it's hard to stay interested in a in a love story. cuz you kind of already know, you know, everything that's going to happen. it's like the the formula gets like boy meets girl. boy has a misunderstanding with girl. and then boy get's reunited with girl at the end or something like that.
have you seen the movie die hard?
yeah, i've seen die hard. man, that is a classic.
what did you like about this kind of movie?
i liked how unpredictable it was. you know, they they kind of get the character stuck into situations that, you know, you wouldn't normally see in an action movie, and then they're kind of forced to, you know, watch it play out.
have you seen the movie the avengers?
yeah, i saw the avengers. it's been a while, though. i don't know if i could tell you about it or not.
what did you like about this kind of movie?
oh, i mean there're always amazing special effects and and crazy action sequences.
and if i recall, you know, the avengers was probably one of the better superhero movies that i saw.
okay. thank you
what type of movies do u enjoy most?
comedy movies.
can u name a movie that fits that category that u really liked?
yeah, airplane! is a good comedy movie.
what are some things about airplane that stuck out to u
it's slapstick comedy, leslie nielsen. it's all it's all fantastic. makes me laugh. it's a good time.
anything else?
no. i mean, it's just a classic. it's fun to watch with my parents, fun to watch with people for the first time, things like that.
is there a comedy movie u didn't enjoy?
i can't think of one right now. but no, yeah. some some comedy movies are pretty bad. they're not very funny. but i just can't think of one off the top of my head unfortunately.
lets see. what makes a good comedy movie in your opinion
the write cast, the writers, others actors in the write together

do you like movies like when harry met sally or good will hunting or transformers
really like good will hunting. transformers, the idea's okay, but the movies are not.
i don't but, i like the genre they're in.
i haven't seen when harry met sally.
for transformers, what is it about this type of movie that you don't like?
mainly the directing, the there's no characters usually it doesn't make any sense, there's no real plot and the transition from scene to scene is bewildering.
and it almost causes emotion sickness.
ok. for good will hunting, what is it about this type of movie that you like?
well, i kind of like the the genre
or the the genius who has to learn to be a genius type movies, or it's similar to i also like con movies and heist movies where there's just somebody who's really smart doing smart things and trying to get away with something, i guess.
do you like the movie the matrix?
yes, it's one of my favorites. it's everything transformers is not.
okay what is it about this type of movie that you like?
well, for matrix it had it had the action it kind of had the similar to like the good will hunting where it somebody like a genius or somebody who is great who has discovered they are great and then also the it has like the it has a little bit of a twist ending on the end that makes the whole movie make sense and it just has a lot of things that i like.
anything about this type of movie that you don't like
more so for the sequels, it can be a little too dense or incomprehensible in what they are trying to get across.

what kinds of movies do you like?
i like science fiction, thrillers, some horror movies, dramas, and a few comedies i think. mainly from childhood i guess.
well tell me why do you like science fiction movies?
well, i think the obvious one being that they show you something you don't experience or never seen before in, you know, our reality. and often times they are a template or it's a way to talk about our reality through some other just, you know, extra worldly imaginative world that the writer or director or whatever creates.
and it's it's fun just to be able to leave and visit a different world, i guess.
cool, what is your favorite movie?
in that genre, or overall?
overall
ooh, that would be tough.
well, the first one that comes in mind oddly is not science fiction, but the movie seven mainly because of how well paced it is i think. yeah, and indie.
interesting, is there a movie you did not like?
well, recently the new jurassic world movie, fallen kingdom i think is the sequel. i didn't i didn't really like the first jurassic world but i i just don't understand why they're as popular as they are when none of the jurassic parks except for the first one has been really very good
and this one is i don't even really remember much about it other than i was kind of bored by it, and things just didn't make any sense.
ok, then have you seen the movie logan
yes, and i very much enjoyed it.
what is it about this kinds of movies that you like or dislike?
about movies like logan?
yes
well, it's a tough question that'll answer cuz i think the reason i like logan was it was it's a superhero movie, but it doesn't feel like a superhero movie and it feels very different than any of the others. so, it's things i like about it is while it's not are not the things i like about other movies. it's very different and it's and it's kind of a town movie, but it felt like a western
hugh jackman as wolverine is iconic. and the fact that they go they went rated r with it really, i think, helped the movie feel more impactful. and that character actually reach the levels that that of the love of why people like that character.

there's been a couple that i got on netflix and just or not netflix, but
redbox and couldn't even finish them. can't think any other names right now but
i can't really think of any.
no big fan of documentaries, but i can't think of any one specific movie that i just hate. although like i said there have been a couple that i'll put in the dvd player and watched about 10 or 15 minutes of it and didn't even finish it. it was so unforgettable that i can't even remember the name of
okay. well lets see, what about documentaries don't you like?
you know, i would like to go to the movies for escape and most documentaries want you to feel something or got a story to tell you. i mean, there are some good ones but i think for the most part is just you know if you want to get educated take a class or something but if you want to go to the movies i want something lively and fun.
something that i don't have to think too much.
or get upset

yes, that's kind of a classic.
have you seen the movie godfather?
yeah, i seen all three of them. the first two being the better of the three. the third one is almost unwatchable.
why do you feel that way?
it was just bad. it was just kind of an afterthought after the two the success of the first two. the third one just seemed like a money grab. it wasn't well written. story wasn't all that good, and i don't know. it just didn't make sense the way it was presented.
do you think they rode the coat tails of the firsts success.
oh yeah. definitely. and you know, i came to it late. i didn't see it when it first came out. i knew what i was getting into, and so it wasn't very surprising. but well it kind of was, cuz it was worse than what i had heard it was, so
but, yeah. the third one was just bad. only the acting wasn't bad, but the writing of the the whole plot was just kind of messed up. compared to the first two, i mean, you're talking about two of the probably the two of the top 10 movies of all times.
they had a lot to live up to.

hello, could you tell the name of a movie that you like?
pathology
what is it about this movie that you like?
i like that the doctors who are seen as people of high moral are going against this moral to commit crimes and cover there murders, it's very interesting and intriguing to me.
what else?
i like the suspense. i like the raunchiness, sex scenes, the murder scenes. is very is very on edge. i like it.
ok. now. could you tell the name of a movie that you dislike?
iron fist
or jessica jones.
what is it about this type movie that you dislike?
i dislike after a few episodes it kind of got still and it felt it felt a little repetitive. like it felt like they were just using fillers to make the season go out or to give people another season. i kind of like the first season where it was very suspenseful and every episode made you feel like you wanted to watch the next one.
have you watched the movie the godfather ? if so, did you like it or dislike it?
i did not watch the movie i heard about it, i know it's a old movie and very reputable like scarface but i haven't seen it.
what about wonder woman
i haven't seen wonder woman as well. i'm actually behind on my movies.like i need to see avengers, i need to see infinity wars, i need to see black panther, so i'm king of behind. i've been busy. i did see the hunger games. i've seen the first one, if i remember.
what about the hunger games
did you like it
i did like it. i like how it was fictional and somehow nonfictional. like it was realistic fiction, put it like that. i like how the people were actually in the simulation and how there were other forces controlling it, kind of think it was like foreshadow, like the matrix, how it has a deeper meaning, some time of, not satire, but just an underlying meaning of it message.
what else?
it i like how it forced people in the hunger games to work together, people that they didn't like, how they end up working together and it it was just very intriguing seeing people change priorities when their life was at stake, and it's very interesting. very on edge.
anything about this kind of movie that you dislike ?
no. i like the first one. i haven't seen the second one, but i like the first one.
any movie that you dislike?
aside from jessica jones, i consider that a movie, and the iron fist, not really, no.
alright. thank you for the information.

what kind of movies do u like to watch, generally
generally i like to stay with science fiction movies, anything that's paranormal or futuristic or anything like that.
can u name a movie that fits that category that you like
yes, the terminator 2 was a really great movie.
what qualities of that movie did u like most?
a great science fiction story with time travel, good characters, and a really good plot that actually made sense.
thanks for sharing. how about a movie in that category that you didn't like
science fiction armageddon, supposedly it was a good movie, but i don't like it. i guess i don't like bruce willis.
yeah. there's a story where it's just really weird, an it felt like they didn't know where they were going with the plot. so it's kind of like club all together into a movie. like splicing 10 different parts together into a movie, and here you go, here's the movie with kind of a plot.
thanks for sharing. this is a bit of a tangent, but did u watch black panther?
i did not. no. i heard it was really bad.
how about captain america?
yes, i did watch captain america. yeah, i thought it was okay.
what about it did u enjoy
i like the the actors, and i i liked the way that they did the action. and how they made the character come to life in the movie.

i like science fiction movies.
is there a movie you can name that you really like?

i think it was called the last jedi.
and can you tell me what you liked about those types of movies?
that was awesome.
perfect, now that i know what movie you like, can you name one you don't like? what would be last on your list?
i wasn't a fan of the ant man movie i saw today. it was not that funny, it was not one of my favorite modern movies. it seemed too contrived.
what about that kind of movie didn't you like?
i just thought they made it up as they went along. it's kind of slow in some parts. it seemed like i was watching a tv show instead of a movie. it didn't seem big budget enough.
thanks for that. by any chance, have you seen the movie reservoir dogs?
no, i haven't seen it yet, but i heard very good things about it. i i'd love to see it.
oh it's amazing. really great characters in it.
have you seen bridesmaids?
it sounds like something i should check out. maybe i'll watch it over the weekend.
it's a funny chick flick.
no, i haven't seen that. i really have not even heard of that movie.
have you seen the matrix series?
oh yeah, i love the matrix movie also real good.i love neo. i love that concept about the red pill and the blue pill, it was a pretty good concept to learn.

great action scenes in that movie.
awesome. thank you so much for your input! it helps tremendously. i appreciate it. have a great day!
see you later
what kinds of movies do you like?
pretty much everything except like hallmark type movies or really really cheesy rom coms or family movies and some documentaries i don't some. if some the documentary is really dry, i can't get into it, it puts me to sleep.
is there something specific you can always watch?
as a movie, or a genre?
genre
probably action movies. i mean it's always fun to watch things blow up, you don't have to put much thought into it but so i guess that's the easiest answer to give.
alright, how about a movie you liked?
in that genre, or overall?
over all please
well, the most-recent one i liked and isn't an action movie, really, is paddington 2. which is a very much a that kind of cheesy family movie i said i don't really like. but it's just enough, and maybe it's cuz of the political climate we're in and everything. so cynical and negative that something that joyous and positive, i enjoyed. whereas if
things were going better in politics or the world. i mean i'd see it as that but yeah, i would answer paddington 2.
interesting, is there a movie you did not like?
can't think of anything recently.
well, there's a movie i always give which is a movie called spartan by david mamet, or at least it's written by david mamet. and it's laughable how he's known for writing and very kind of his dialog and characters and i thought it was somebody making fun of his style, but it wasn't.
it was all in earnest and it it was just awful it made me laugh throughout the whole thing, how bad it was.
ok, then have you seen the movie the martian ?
matt damon? yes. and read the book.
what is it about these kinds of movies that you like or dislike?
well, for that movie, it's kind of for the movie i there was a question before where you're asking about what movie i could or genre i could always watch. that's always going to be die hard. and i think the martian is very similar in that it's a man trying to outwit his circumstances. in die hard, it's he's just an every-day joe cop guy
in the martian, you know, he's a scientist, really smart guy. but it's seeing him be very confident figuring out in a very dangerous situation that how to survive, and that was very fun to watch.
wonderful. thank you for sharing. good bye.

what kind of movies do u like watching
i like watching action adventure movies. i watch a lot of comedy. i'm into comedy. i like i was starting to get into new stuff like documentaries and biopics. that's probably like a new thing i want i'm trying out for a bit.
can u name a movie that fits one of those categories that u really liked?
let's see. the last movie i've seen that fits one of my pics. it's a documentary. it's called the it's about the fyre festival.
what qualities about the movie did u like?
it went onto how everything started and about the guy the person who went about in starting the festival. and how it became from a good idea to a huge mess at the end and how he how the aftereffects affected him in real life.
got it. glad i got to know what it's about. what about the documentary did u like
like i said, about knowing how it started, and how the guy who started it went about scamming all these innocent people, and at the end he got arrested at the end because what he did was horrible. and everything became a huge mess, and it became a social social media thing where everybody was talking about it.
so u like more so the story, but not necessarily anything about how it's filmed, the narrative, or anything like that?
i like how it's it was filmed because they used different perspective. like they used footage from cameras from people who went. footage from people who were working on there. they used like a whole bunch of different footage from different camera types.
but yeah, i really did enjoy the story more than anything because it was a big big deal when it aired because that was one of the biggest things to go wrong in 2018.
ok. can u now name me a movie that fits one of those categories that you didn't like?
that i didn't like. it's kind of hard cuz i like a lot of movies. but comedy wise, i'll choose the sherlock movie with will ferrell.

did u like this movie
it was okay. they could have done they could have done better with the story. it wasn't like memorable like the others x-mans stories that i enjoyed.
why is that
i feel like
whoever wrote the movie, changed it around the third act and it was just like really like
it's leading up to something good then you get dissatisfied with what you got at the end, basically.
awesome, what kinds of movies that you like?
i like thrillers.
what is it about thrillers that you like?
they keep you on you toes while you're are watching, coz you know assuming what's going to happen. you know its interesting especially if its a mystery thriller, trying to figure out the solution before the characters in the movie do.
is there a particular movie you like?
i like dial m for murder a lot.
why do you like that movie?
it's just well written, and it's an interesting story and a neat idea. it's just well executed. i like alfred hitchcock movies a lot, so

i didn't like a knight's tale.
why not?

thank you for your feedback. enjoy your evening.
thank you.
do you like movies like bridesmaids?
oh, love bridesmaids.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you like?
well, the cast was perfect. at the time, these were well known actresses but not superstars. they best became superstars after the movie. but they still cast it correctly and didn't try to go for a bigger name and that net didn't necessarily hit the rocks, so that part they got completely correct. it was it's also more of a body comedy, it's not little not afraid to be
raunchy, real, definitely a more realistic way of how women talk when they're just by themselves together. love the whole movie, love the cast love the movie.
what about movies like superbad?
superbad was okay.
can you say a little more about that please?
sure, when i saw superbad i was probably
in my very late 20s or maybe early 30s. so i was sort of out of the time when that was probably if i was maybe 10 years younger, i may have loved it. but it was a little juvenile for me even though it was funny, it did not resonate with why they were so obsessed with it. but it was funny, it was entertaining, it just wasn't didn't i didn't come away with it being a favorite or anything. it is sort of a it's a high school tale and that doesn't usually affect
what age i see that at i can remember high school too right now even though i'm nowhere near my high school age but that one was just okay for me.
okay. what about movies like transformers?
i don't like transformers.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you dislike?
well, i love action movies. and in theory i could love transformers, however transformers is way more about sort of the action the you know the imagery that they're putting on film as opposed to making an actually good film. they're more they're more concerned with like the pyrotechnics, and the getting the action sequences right which can be exciting but in terms of trying to get through 2 hours it's not
you would want to watch again. so it's it's okay. it's not it's sort of light on entertainment. there are other movies that i sort of that summer blockbuster that could have used a lot more time focusing on the script to make it into a more complete movie.
okay. thank you
what types of movies do you usually see?
i really enjoy comedies. they're my favorite.
is there a movie you really liked?
well
i liked 21 jump street the most recent one but
i like a lot of movies with
your typical comedy actors
cool. what did you like about it?
it was funny, and it had some witty and clever scenes in it that really made me laugh.
i enjoy adult humor as well.
got it. what’s one of the worst movie you’ve seen?
i believe one of the worst movies i've seen was i think i believe it was night of the living dead. i really didn't care for that movie.
why didn’t you like it?
i thought it was a bit cheesy, and the graphics or special effects were terrible, and the plot just wasn't very good.
ok. did you like hotel artemis?
i don't believe i've watched that movie.
ok, how about the commuter?
i'm not sure if i've watched that one either. i think i would have to know a little bit more about it to recall.
did you see birdman?
yes, i did.
great. what did you like about that kind of movie?
well, i felt like birdman was it was interesting. it was funny.
well, you know, it has some funny parts in it and i liked michael keaton.
is there something else that stands out about this kind of movie?
well
you know, i like the superhero concept of it. so i thought that was pretty good.
alright, did you like captain america: civil war?
yeah, i liked captain america: civil war. i thought it was pretty good, interesting, you know, it's always great when the good guy wins at the end of the day.
okay. can you think of anything else about this kind of movie that you liked?
well, yeah. i just i enjoy whenever good versus bad and, you know, good wins. and, you know, when people have the superheroes have other special abilities.
okay. thank you for your time.
thank you.
what kind of movies do you enjoy and why?
i really like movies based on historical events.
is there a particular film you enjoy?

what did you like about that kind of film?
there's a ton of, you know, character development, emotional death, showing the atrocities from that civil war, and genocide. it really tugs at your heartstrings.
is there a particular movie you don't enjoy?
i didn't like titanic. they embellished the romance that has been too much and a lot of inaccuracies in the movie.
what didn't you like about that kind of film?
there is a lot of inaccurate things. and they focused a bit too much on the romance, rather than the historical aspect of it.
have you heard about the movie downfall?
i have not. what's it about?
have you seen the movie the patriot?
i have. the patriot's a really good movie.
what did you enjoy about this kind of movie?
even though they did embellish a bit, i liked that they show how brutal war can be, and there's not always one good side.
can you tell me what types of movies you enjoy watching?
lately i've been really into movies that are documentary and especially ones that show what's happening behind the scenes, what's involved in making film.
alright, what’s one of your favorite movies?
let me think of one. i really liked okay, it's by richard linklater. i can't remember the name of it. but it was the one where like there were four different movies happening on the screen at once. do you know the name of it?
hmm, let me think..
oh, oh, i know what it was. it was waking life.
ahhh, okay.
and you said you really liked it because..?
it was just technically really interesting because there were there were four different movies happening on the screen at once like the screen was segmented and there were four different things happening at once.
that sounds pretty cool!
ok. now tell me about a movie you didn’t like.
let's see.
i didn't like skyscraper. i thought that was kind of boring.
what did you not like about that one?
i just don't think the plot was very good. i thought it was it was just super super formulaic and predictable.
i see. have you seen the movie ant-man?
yes, i have. liked it very much.
paul rudd is a little bit of an antihero.
no pun intended.
haha and what did you like about that kind of movie?
i like antihero movies like ant-man, ant-man and the wasp, deadpool, deadpool 2, stuff like that.
i like the dark comedy.
oh, ok. how about hotel transylvania? have you seen that one?
is that tim burton?
it's an animated movie. let me see if it's the one you're thinking of.

alright, have you see iron man?
yes.
what did you think of it?
i like that very much. i like like robert downey jr.

i liked the dialog. i think the script was really well written, and it was well directed, too. i can't remember the name of the guy who directed it, but i think he was in it, also.
jon favreau directed it
yeah, that's the guy.
can you tell me what type of movies you like?
i like comedy movies.

because they make me laugh and they keep me entertained, and
that's why.
great, can you name a comedy movie you really like?
dirty grandpa
great, can you name a movie you really don't like?
project x
why didn't you like that movie?
because it just it didn't have much of a plot. just a bunch of people running around naked.
there wasn't a lot of dialog. i think think there was there was dialog missing. there should have been more people talking.
that's why.
got it, have you watched the lord of the rings, fellowship of the ring?
yes, i have.

i guess it was funny but it was just too bizarre. i don't know. the story was over the top, ridiculous.
thank you for your input, have a nice day
you, too.
hello. can you tell me, what type of movies do you like?
i like thrillers.
and fantasy movies.
okay. great. why do you like fantasy movies?
they are fun and i escape this, i guess.
they're pretty, usually, and interesting premise.
so do you like movies like harry potter?
yeah.
do you like the lore?
the lore of harry potter
yeah
yeah.
can you tell me the title of one of your favorite movies?
i really like
i like baby driver. that was pretty good.
what did you like about baby driver?
all the music matching up with everything is pretty nice. the plot was interesting and the characters were interesting. mostly the music and the visuals were really nice.
what did you think of the ending?
the ending was pretty satisfying. like it was nice to see him get off his ear because he gave the old lady her purse.
it's nice that he got out of jail and that he got out of the driving business or whatever.
what type of movies do you not like?
i don't really like old movies, either. stuff with low production value.
is it because they try too hard to make you laugh?
no, it's because they don't try hard enough.
okay. thanks
what kinds of movies do you like?
i really like action movies.
why do you like action movies?
i like the special effects and the fighting scenes.
alright, how about a movie you liked?
i really liked the matrix.
why did you like that movie?
i liked the matrix because of the special effects and the slow motion and the science fiction story line.
interesting, is there a movie you did not like?
i did not like
the parent trap
oh. why not?
i thought it was boring and not interesting.
ok, then have you seen the movie john wick?
i have not seen john wick.
have you heard of it?
i have heard of it, and i i do want to see it because it stars keanu reeves.
ok, then have you seen the movie creed ii
i have not seen creed ii, but i just heard about it from some friends who who wanted to see it in theater.
ok, how about die hard
i have seen part of die hard.
what is it about these kinds of movies that you like or dislike?
i just like a movie that is fast paced, and has actions, good cinematography, and a storyline that makes sense. i often like science fiction.
wonderful. thank you for sharing. good bye.
well, goodbye.
tell me what kind of movies you dislike?
i don't really like romantic movies.
why's that?
i find them boring and uninteresting, most likely because i don't just don't enjoy them.
what makes you feel that way?
i lose interest in a movie real fast. it just doesn't catch my eye so to speak, and sometimes i even doze off. so, i try to stop to watch them.
i see. so what kind of movies do you like?
i like more action and science fiction movies.
why do you like those kinds of movies?
i find it interesting science fiction to speculate on the future, and they keep my mind entertained and engrossed in the movie.
great. and what's a kind of movie you're intereseted in seeing soon?
i actually haven't seen the new spider-man movie yet that came out a while ago, and i'm interested in seeing that if i get some free time.
why's that?
i like spider-man. i like the action hero universe.
great. and what's a movie you've seen that you liked?
i really like really older movies. terminator 2, that was a really good action movie with a great plot.
what about it was good?
great action scenes, the plot also made sense even though there is time travel and other things involved. and it seems like something that could become realistic.
great. now what's a movie you've seen that you didn't like that much?
dumb and dumber. it was supposed to be funny, but i guess it lived up to its name. it was really dumb.
given what you've said i'm curious if you saw thor: the dark world
i have not, although i want to see it at some point. the lack of time for watching movies is my big problem.
i see. have you seen the fifth element?
yes.
what did you like?
it was really strange, actually, but i enjoyed the action and the different plots and the visuals in the movie. i think the director did a really good job in framing the shots and making it look spectacular.
wonderful. thank you so much for your time. you've been a great help
what kinds of movies do you typically enjoy?
my favorite are romantic comedies.
what do you enjoy about those kinds of movies?
i love the happy ending. i love that it's fun funny, a little bit of romance, and nice and light hearted very easy to watch.
okay that's great. now what's a movie you've seen that you really liked? maybe your favorite movie or something that was just fun for you?
you've got mail is one of my all-time favorites.
why did you like that kind of movie?
the casting is excellent, and the writing is so great. it's like endearing, but it's also funny. it's also clever. has some even though romantic comedies are kind of predictable, there's still some sort of twists and turns that you don't necessarily see coming, so it's a very enjoyable watch. i can watch it at any time, rewatch it, and it always puts me in a good mood.
great. now can you name for me a movie you didn't particularly enjoy?
sure, ugly truth that's just a bad movie it's a they built it as a romantic comedy but really it was sort of like a gross out of comedy and it was definitely surrounding a relationship but it was just bad. the acting which they had good actors in it but the writing was terrible, the direction was terrible, what they were going for was anything but what a romantic comedy gives off. it was not endearing it was not something
that you root for. and what they made that they thought were jokes were not funny.
i see. that's very helpful. are there any kinds of movies you tend to avoid because of this movie? or just in general you don't like?
yes, i do avoid movies with gerard butler he's with the stars of this movie and this movie along with a few others have convinced me i just i'm not a fan of his acting. he's not as dynamic as people try to say he is. he's acting is average at best but really he's missing a sort of charisma an on air presence that i really that i can sort of get behind.
i see. are there any movies coming out soon that you're interested in seeing?
captain marvel looks good.
why does it look good to you?
i think i like brie i like brie larson, she's a star.
i like the
i think that i like a super hero movie so i think i will like this. the action, the excitement, usually super hero movies have better story lines than regular action movie so i look forward to that too. i don't really know the captain marvel story, but i think that will be good.
oh cool, speaking of superhero movies, did you see the incredibles 2?
i like the first one a lot. it's an animated movie, which can be very juvenile. but this one was very easy to like as an adult. it's just funny and cute, it definitely worked. so, i'm definitely interested in seeing a second one.
okay great, that's very good to know. now what about batman v. superman? did you see it?
no. the reviews of it weren't good, so it just ended up me being deciding to pass on it.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like horror movies.
why do you like those kinds of movie?
i like these kinds of movies because
keeps me at the edge of my seat makes me
it makes me wonder what's going to happen next. i just love the i just love the killings and the people like getting killed and all that all that type of stuff.
what particular movie did you like
yeah, jason x. i like jason x. i like jason x.
why did you like that movie?
because jason just looks so powerful when he just he just goes on a mission kill everyone inside a spaceship, so and the way that he kills people is just makes me excited. and i just like how everyone's out to get jason, but he won't die. he just keeps on returning, and he just keeps on killing people.
just find that amusing.
that's awesome
what particular movie did you not like?
i didn't like the movie called pokémon: the first movie.
what about the movie did you dislike?
i didn't like that it didn't have much of a dialog. it didn't have a plot much to it. just a bunch of pokémons just a bunch just a bunch of pokémons getting scared of mewtoo just getting scared of mewtoo and and i just didn't really do it didn't really do much in a it just didn't have much character development, just the same old thing. i think the tv shows were better than the movie than the first than the first pokémon movie.
just not a fan of it.
it didn't really made me feel like wow, this is a good movie. it just didn't make me feel excited about it.
alright, well have you seen the nun?
no, i've never seen that movie before.
i've never seen it.
hello
what kind of movies do you like?
i like documentaries.
why do you like documentaries?
what did you like about that documentary?
can you tell me a movie you did not like?
yeah, i watched about the first 5 minutes of the ali g movie. i don't remember the title of it, but it was just absolutely terrible, gut wrenching, just absolutely awful, absolutely awful. i'm not i don't want to watch something if it's that bad, you know. i watched the first 10 minutes. i thought, this is not going to be good, so i just sort of left it at that, even though i love the tv show. it was kind of weird, because i thought it would be a lot better than what it was.
i see
yeah, i see a lot i see that with a lot of movies, too. like i haven't seen that amy schumer movie, the one with her with the alcohol bottle, but i heard that was really bad, as well.
how do you feel about the matrix?
i have not seen the matrix, but i like the i've heard about it so much, but like i've never actually seen it myself. but i hear about like the pills, and like i hear references to it, but i've never actually seen it on tv.
oh. what about wonder woman?
wonder woman, i've never seen, either. but i've heard the tv show is pretty good for the wonder woman.
what about the god father?
i have seen the godfather, and that is a good piece of cinematic work. that is really really good. i really enjoyed it.
it was really creative and inventive.
gotcha. thanks for the input today.
take care.
hello, can you please name one of your favourite movie?
saving private ryan
what is it about this type of movie that you like?
i enjoy historical movies, and war movies, action movies, and the first 20 minutes of that movie are some of the most visceral war movie making ever, and the rest of it is just a good story that shot well, and
i think makes you feel what felt like to be in world war ii, maybe.
ok. now. could you tell the name of a movie that you dislike?
there's a movie by i can't remember his name now. it's called spartan.
oh, yeah, it's written by david mamet.
and the reason i don't like it is mamet is a very stylized writer, and i thought it was laughable what he wrote our house part the dialogue and everything. it was awful.
have you watched the movie the hunger games ?
seen the first one and i think the second one. and they're all right. they're not
i like them fine, but you know, because i stop at two, clearly they didn't there was no momentum that i wanted to finish the series.
anything about this kind of movie that you dislike ?
about hunger games
maybe it's a i would have to really think about that one, but if i had to guess, it was probably because it's a i think it was a pg-13 movie, and i feel like the premise warrants a more of a rated r mature look at the story. 
i think it tried to be it undercut its purpose in what it was trying to say about the dystopia by being a pg-13 movie for teenagers, if i had to guess, but
ok. now. have you watched the movie dunkirk ?
yes.
did you like it?
i thought the nolan does really well with sound design and manipulating you through sound and visual, but he broke it up the narrative of it and it was it was unnecessarily hard to follow. it made sense by the end, but it didn't help the story, and i thought it took away from what he was trying to get across. 
and he kept taking me out of the movie, whereas some might say even wright ryan that is very impassive, i thought don cork was the opposite of that except for the sounds and it was shot well. but there is very little character development, i can't name you any other characters or really any of the stories of the characters were.
so, i would say i'm kind of in the middle on that movie, but slightly to the negative.
alright. thank you for the information.
you're welcome. goodbye.
what type of movies do you like?
comedies.
okay what do you like about comedies?
that they make me happy when i don't feel like i have any other reason to be happy. they give distract.
can you tell me the title of one of your favorite movies?
white chicks
can you say why you like that type of movie?
it's just a funny
like nonchalant, non-being too serious type of a movie that i appreciate about the commentary of where we are as a state of americans.
do you like movies like goodfellas?
yes.
what about movies like alien?
yes.
what type of movies do you not like?
i don't i don't like historical movies.
why?
they're boring. i don't care about what happened in the past, i'm here in the future. those things just have nothing relevant to my life.
so you like movies that are relatable?
yes.
okay. thanks
thank you.
what type of movies do you like?
i like horror movies.
why is that?
i just like the psychological parts of it. i like the psychological horrors over the gory stuff.
what is one of your favorite movies?
one of my favorite movies is 1408 by stephen king. well, based on a stephen king book.
what did you like about this movie?
well, everything like like i said it was a psychological horror and you never knew what was going to happen, but it was scary at the same time not just a dramatic but frightening. i like being scared.
what type of movies do you not like?
i don't like action movies.
why?
i just find the scenes boring where they're fighting or chasing.
and pointless
have you seen the movie pan's labyrinth?
no.
how about the sixth sense?
yes.
what did you like about this kind of movie?
i like the suspense of not knowing what's going on and then finally finding out near the end.
okay. what about the movie the babadook?
no. i have not seen that.
okay. thank you
lets start with some of your favorite kinds of movies
okay. i like documentaries, drama movies
comedies
i see, why do you like those kinds of movies?
well, i like documentaries because they're usually informative and provide information on a topic i may not be aware of. i like drama. just a genre that i prefer. it's always something interesting or something that holds my attention. and i like comedies because they make me laugh.
that's great, now if you can help me by telling me about a recent movie experience you've had i'd appreciate it
okay, my husband and i recently watched white boy rick and i found that to be very entertaining and interesting because it's based on a true story.
would you say you like that kind of movie a lot?
yes.
excellent. now can we talk about movies you dislike in general?
sure. don't really like horror movies or scary movies. they seem to give me bad dreams. not too big on action movies where everybody's either shooting or stealing cars all the time.
why don't you like those kinds of films?
well horror movies don't like to think about it. they give me bad dreams. i had an uncle who used to make me watch them when i was a child. and action movies, i don't feel like there's enough of a story line there sometimes. it's just all about what's going on in the movie at that moment, but no real substance to it.
that makes sense to me. it's a fair reason
okay.
based on what you've said i'm curious if you saw the recent marry poppins movie
no, i don't watch a lot of children based movies. animated or i see those movies as more for children. i might watch one with my niece or something, but not by myself.
so you'd consider seeing it if your niece wanted to but otherwise it's not really your style right?
right.
have you heard of if beale street could talk, which was based on historic instances.
i have heard of that, i'm actually interested in checking that out sometime.
why would you be interested in it?
well, i know the director won an oscar for moonlighting. i think that was the name of it. but i like that genre of movie, historical with some fact based stuff in it too.
what kind of movies to you like, and why do you like this type of movie?
i like thrillers because they leave me on the edge of my sit.
can you name a particular movie that you like?
you were never really here

it was pretty intense and the acting was really good.

they generally seem
more they seem more factual. like i know they're not necessarily more factual, but they seem less exaggerated than other types of movies that are fictional in nature.
got it, can you name a specific film you enjoyed?
i would say full metal jacket.
and i like that movie just cuz, well, you know, that kind of points out what i was talking about. like how like the first half of the movie is just the the
soldiers and boot camp, you know, like
there's it seemed pretty authentic to the whole vietnam war. like
yeah.
ok, can you tell me what genres of movies you don't like?
i don't really like
romance movies just because i don't i don't really give in to the whole romance thing. like romantic comedies are one thing, but i'm talking just talking like straight romance. you know, where it's not it's a serious romance film. i don't
i don't know, it doesn't appeal to me. but i'm a guy so i mean i guess i kind of make sense. i'm not really fixated on relationships the same way that a lot of women are that those kind movies appeal to.
ok, can you name a specific film you didn't like? it doesn't have to be a romantic movie but it can be
i can't think of any particular movie i didn't like.
i mean, yeah. i can't really think of a specific movies. i can think of types of movies, and i can think of you know, but yeah, i can't really think of anything specific.
no problem, can you tell me have you seen the movie aquaman
no, i've not.
what type of movies do you like?
i like science fiction movies.
why do you like those genres?
because it's out of this world. it talks about it talks about unusual stuff that happens like e.t.
talks about aliens and such and so forth
what's one of your favorite movies?
one of my favorite movies is space jam.
do you like movies like the matrix?
yeah, i like it.
what about movies like alien?
i've never seen that movie before.
what type of movies do you not like?
let's see, movies i don't like. crossroads, the movie with britney spears in it. i didn't like it because it just
didn't have much of a dialog. it was just too self-centered around britney spears. i didn't like it because of that reason.
do you not like musicals?
i don't think i've ever seen a musical movie before. so i'm not really a fan of that.
do you like movies like the godfather?
yeah, if i like movies i pick out because there is a lot of action, guns, shooting, violence, yeah. keeps me on the edge of my seat. so, yeah, it's good.
there's also good dialogue too
yep.
okay. thank you.
what kind of movies do you like?
i'm not too i'm not too picky about movies, but i like sci-fi or animation, sometimes comedy, but nowadays, comedy isn't as good as it used to be, i don't think. i love action movies and and drama movies. on occasion, a romance movie, but not too much with romance. i really don't care for movies that are medieval type
movies, i don't know, i just never took an interest in like, you know, the lord of the rings and harry potter, and they're okay but they are not my favorites.
nice, why do you like sci-fi?
i like it's interesting, usually good graphics, good story line. you know, you got stuff like alien movies, and you've got dinosaur movies. you've got neverending story and edward scissorhands almost, and it's pretty cool, and they're usually good movies to watch, and they they draw you into them.
is there a particular movie that you like?
i like some old movies like the return to oz. i like edward scissorhands. i like neverending story, and that's pretty much it for that genre.
why did you like return to oz
it's it's a little bit more scary than the wizard of oz. it's unique, and it's different, and and it used to kind of creep me out when i when i was a kid, but i still enjoy it.
alright, how about a movie you did not like?
i guess i didn't really care for the lord of the rings that much. i think it was it was too much of a hype into it. it was it was good, but it wasn't my favorite, but a lot of people liked it. i just wasn't into that kind of stuff. it's not my type of movie?
well, have you seen forrest gump ?
oh yes, i have.
what is it about these kinds of movies that you like or dislike?
usually they have a a unique story adventure type that you know i'm not bored, and i'm like not drifting off into like daydreaming or something or wanting to take a nap while the movie's playing. that's usually how i judge if i like it or not.
wonderful thank you for sharing
what kind of movies do you like?
i really like romantic comedies.
why do you enjoy this genre and is there a specific film?
yes. the genre is one that is well, it's funny. so you're going to have more lighthearted comedy, which is great. you so you kind of come away with a happy ending. it's focused around a romance. it's just a it's a good time. it's lighthearted. it's a really great escape. in terms of a favorite, one of my favorites is called
one of my favorites is called catch and release, and that's actually a more that's a romantic yeah, it's it's different. it's sort of it is a romantic comedy, but it has a little more seriousness to it because at the start of it, it's goes off of following somebody's death, so it's sort of like a quieter movie, and it's not as laugh out loud as a lot of comedies
but it's still very funny. it's humorous i should say. it has very humorous parts and it has really really enduring characters and they are totally rooting for the romance to happen and it's just it really is even though it started with a death, it's very fun and light-hearted movie that ends fantastically.
is there a movie you dislike?
i really didn't like a good day to die hard.
what makes you dislike it?
so a good day to die hard is a movie i dislike. that is a action movie, but i usually like action movies, and in fact, a good day to die hard is part of a series of movies, the die hard series. so i thought i thought i would like it, except this one is terrible. it has it does have good technical action sequences, but the storyline is terrible. they don't use the main character from entire series well. 
the supporting characters basically just terrible. there's there's there's use of subtitles a lot which is kind of strange given that it's coming in series that's all spoken in english. it's it was really really disappointing. it wasn't a very well thought out movie. and it also very i guess gloomy. sort of the way was short. it was it was it was
very gloomy. it was really disappointing. it was bad but it was even more disappointing.
have you seen the movie crazy rich asians?
i haven't seen that yet but i really want to.
have you seen the movie the wife?
no, i don't think so.
have you seen the movie bridesmaids?
absolutely.
did you enjoy this film?
i love bridesmaids.
what do you like about it?
you know what? bridesmaids is funny from start to finish. and they really really nailed the cast. at the time, some of them were kind of more unknown, especially in a movie context. but they really nailed the cast, and even though the movie itself got attention for the true laugh out loud moments, some of the more quieter moments, the sort of humorous, maybe not laugh out loud things were some of my favorite parts of the movie. so but it really
works start to finish. it's a great movie.
have you seen the movie the shape of water?
i have not.
have you seen the movie star wars?
yes, of course.
what did you think about this film?
star wars is iconic. it is epic. i love i love the star wars films. it's it's an event. you know, you go it's it's really it really is an immersive experience in a completely different world. but it it's it's a lot of fun. you have to you have to just immerse yourself in it and enjoy the ride.
see you later
bye.
when you look to watch a movie, what kind of movie is it usually?
something interesting and different. it doesn't have to be recent, and i like it usually i'll look at the reviews to make sure that it's not a bad movie that'll waste my time.
do you use things like rotten tomato scores??
yes, i do. yep. and i'd like to get an input from other people, not not movie critics most of the time.
okay, do you have a movie or multiple, you like rewatching?
yeah, i have a few. i like re-watching back to the future and the original ghostbusters and the original spider-man.
interesting! those are some older action movies, right?
yes, they're actually great.
how come you like those over the remakes?
the remakes aren't as it feels empty. it feels like the storyline isn't there, like it feels like it compromises in some ways. it just isn't as just interesting to watch. though that may be because i watched them years ago, and it just seems better than you know, they would be if you'd seen them the first time.
interesting! too bad the remakes aren't even better than the originals
that seem to be a trend, doesn't it
yes.
hmm.. yeah, i agree... okay, let's see.. keeping that in mind, do you have a movie in mind, you really don't like
or not care to watch in the first place?
well, talking about action movies and superheroes, i really really dislike the catwoman movie.
wow, catwoman! okay that one is also a bit older. what did you not like about it?
it wasn't true to the original storyline, like how the character was thought out. and they changed everything about it, and just made i think they just made it for the box office. and it just wasn't entertaining at all.
did you read the original comic?
yes, i did.
and it didn't compare to it at all, did it
no, the movie had its own script that was written by like 20 different people, i believe. it was really just wasn't good.
oh boy, that is very unfortunate.. maybe also the reason a remake hasn't come out yet
right, i don't think it will ever come out.
why do you think that??
it was it was universally hated, as far as i know.
and it bombed at the box office.
what kind of movies to you like, and why do you like this type of movie?

sure, best in show is one of my absolute favorites.
ok, why do you like that movie?
oh gosh. it's like i'ts perfect. it's a mockumentary style film and they are mocking the dog show world. so, the dog show world that they show is like a carbon copy of the real thing because it's inherently funny, so they don't have to really max with it. and a lot of the player they it there's a script for the movie but it's also ad libed.
it's just hilarious. it's so original.
so much, so different, and just so funny. it makes you laugh every time you watch it.
ok, would you say you enjoy satire?
yeah.
ok, can you name a film you dislike?
sure, bounty hunter.
why didn't you like that movie?
it was supposed to be a comedy, and not only was it not funny, it was confusing what they were going for. i think it was miscast.
it's jennifer aniston and i can't even think of his name, but somebody who i don't really care for. but i do like jennifer usually, and it wasn't a good fit for her. neither role really fit the actor, like they were sort of playing against type in both roles. i think it was kind of supposed to be almost like a almost like a buddy comedy, but or cuz it was really focused on two people, but not really buddies, but they were in conflict. it wasn't funny.
it kind of had like a more dramatic feel to it because it wasn't funny. it was just it was odd. really.
was the acting bad?
it wasn't great. it was not great.
ok, can you tell me have you watched the movie the shawshank redemption?
oh, yes.
do you like that movie?
it's a excellent movie.
ok, what about the movie did you enjoy?
it really has a different feel to it. it's despite them being, you know, prisoners, they create very endearing characters who you rooting for, who you want to see have a better life. it is a you're transported to a different time so you can sort of capture what was going on better.
it very moving, it very and and it's very touching which usually does not happen with something that's sort of a prison drama. i don't you ever really view them as true prisoners some of whom shouldn't really have gotten as steep of sentences as they do or like somebody who walks who was there far too long for what it sounded like he was in for and then couldn't live in the real world having been locked up so long. so, it's it's it's a it's just a it's a excellent film.
with amazing acting, wonderful direction and it's just it's very special. it it really is. it's it's one of those wonder you look back and you wonder why didn't want to win oscar.

thank you for your feedback. enjoy your evening.
can you tell me what types of movies you like?
i like documentaries, biographies, and horror, like vintage horror movie british.
ok, why do you like those types of movies?
i get a sense of nostalgia, and there isn't things flying through the air. and they use real people, real scenes, and no green screen. and there aren't like superhuman powers in the movies. like i can relate to these movies better because they show real people doing real things, or they're in real houses.
got it, you like more realistic movies
yeah. yes.
ok, can you name a film you really liked?
tales from the crypt the haunting
there's many others. yeah, the haunting. the original haunting that came out in 1963 or '62.
ok, why did you like the haunting?
because there wasn't anything scary in it, but the whole the atmosphere was very scary. it was filmed in a house that was a real mansion. the outside was a real mansion, and the outside house was in a a real estate was a real estate and was used in another movie, horror movie, that was made in the early '70s.
it was very suspenseful.
great, can you name a film you dislike?
yeah, the the remake of the haunting.
ok, why didn't you like that movie?
i don't know. it wasn't as good as the first one. the first one was almost like a hitchcock movie. it was so well done. nothing ever happened in the movie, but you just there was so much suspense, and you just imagined so much. the movie made you imagine. and the original movie was in black and white. it was just a really good concept, and it was so well done.
got it, so the remake didn't have the same qualities as the original
yes. so, yeah, you could say that. i could tell you another movie that i really liked that i just thought of.
sure
it's the house that drip blood that was with rodney mcdowell. it was a british movie and it took place in a real mansion. like the outside, they showed the real outside. i don't know maybe the inside was the set. but, they also had i think this was the movie that also had likein the beginning it
had the winchester estate, not the winchester estate, churchill winston churchill's estate. there was a picture of someone in winston churchill's estate. there was a video of someone in winston churchill's estate at the beginning of this movie.
that that's a real place. they don't make movies like that anymore. the the last documentary sort of miniseries they made was not brideshead revisited.
downton abbey, that was a good mini-series because it was filmed on location, in an estate.
what type of movies do you like?
i like dramas.
what type of dramas?
usually, i like more family or friend dramas more so than ones that are sort of tearful.
why is that?
i i really appreciate a slice of life drama, but i don't necessarily want to be brought to tears. i don't need it to be a sad i don't know where somebody is has a illness or something like that which can be a lot of focuses of many dramas. but, there are plenty that are more of a slice of life and there're executed really well so it's a very nice it still provides an escape despite
being realist and drama based.
what is one of your favorite movies?
but the usual suspects is one of my favorite movies.
i really liked that movie. what did u think of the ending?
it's still shocking. i i mean it it was so long ago and it's still one of the best executed movies that has ever been where you just did not see the ending coming. it's amazing.
what type of movies do you not like?
i'm not crazy about sci-fi movies.
because?
because
sometimes they are a little too overreaching. they are creating a world, like a maybe a dystopian or futuristic, or some kind apocalyptic world, and so it can become very, very complicated. and some of them are really done well, but the majority of them seem to overreach, and so you have to sort of figure out one part of the movie to like because the rest is sort of a mess.
that's very true
have you heard of the movie the greatest showman?
yes.
what did you like or dislike about this kind of movie?
i like musicals. so, that really is basically a musical, and so it really does fall into that category. i like the sort of grandness of what they're going for, and it's a really great cast. really it's an interesting story but a really great cast.
okay. have you seen the movie love actually?
oh, yes.
what did you like about this kind of movie?
that's an all-time favorite, so it is a a romantic comedy. but it's actually i think it's nine romantic comedies in one movie, so it's like nine vignettes put together in one movie. and despite it being split up into so many different stories, every single one feels very complete. you don't feel like it's lacking, so it's a it's a little bit of a longer movie. but it's appropriately long, it's so
fun. so heart-warming and just a a wonderful movie. you could watch it a million times, and it's absolutely great to watch near the holidays.
definitely a classic. i liked seeing each story
yes. yes.
okay. thank you so much
you're welcome
what type of movies do you like?
i love action movies, i absolutely love action movies.
what do you like about action movies?
like for instance for the action, you know? i love the action, i love the lines. lines are always big charismatic lines. they're always super super fun, they can use if you like if you've seen any of the transformers movies, those lines are lit.
do you like superhero movies?
oh yeah. yeah, spot on, dude. spot on. i just loved the ant-man on amazon. i love that movie. who would have thought an amazon-produced movie could have been good, right? well as it turns out, they got us, cuz that's a really good movie.
what did u like about it?
i love the the superhero itself. it's such an interesting concept for a superhero, the ant-man. the ant-man, i mean think about that for a second. who could have pitched that to a studio and they would have been like, yeah, that's a good idea. i mean, it's such a phenomenal movie, such a phenomenal plot. if you haven't seen it
go out and see it because it's a really good movie.
will do
all right.
can you name me a movie you didn't like?
yeah, i didn't like the suicide squad movie. i really i really didn't like that movie i thought that one was like they sold out of it on that one. they just like they are delivering these lines they like i didn't really find good or funny. i don't think the plot was good. some of the plot like they forced people to appear and you can tell like they are setting up for a sequel like when they say when they say like well, you can just tell they are setting up for a sequel and then
came out with the sequel, and i didn't go see that, because i thought the first one's worse. like i'm not going to sit through something so terrible. and it's just the properties too, like none of the actors i'm not saying the actors aren't good or the plot isn't good or the story isn't good, but a lot of that's tertiary to the to the sale, you know?
yeah, i see what u mean
have you heard of the movie inception?
i've heard of that movie, but i've not seen it. i heard one of my friends talked about he liked it, but i haven't seen it, myself.
i heard it didn't age well, but you know, i don't know.
what about the movie batman begins?
yeah. love that movie. love that movie. saw it with my now ex girlfriend, at the cinema on 42nd avenue down in long beach, and i loved it. loved it. loved it.
what did you like about it?
love robin.
hello
hi.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like animated movies.
why do you like those kinds of movies?
because they make me laugh. it also was
me being me being young again, because i'm currently 28. makes me feel like i'm young, like i'm 10 or 11, 12.
can you name a particular movie you like?
particular movie i like, huh?
billy madison
what did you like about that movie?
i like that movie is that it's it's a story about a guy who didn't do well in school, but has a second chance at doing better in life by taking school seriously and passing all of his grades that he has to under contact with his dad, and he has to pass all his grades and even though there's someone that's trying to not make that happen.
it's a story about good versus evil so i like it a lot.
i see. can you tell me a movie you did not like?
movie i didn't like was pokémon the first movie.
how come you did not like it?
i don't like it because it was too cartoon-ish, the plot wasn't that good.
it wasn't that different from the the episodes that i watched. it wasn't really mind-blowing like episodes during the pokémon series that i had going, so
it didn't leave me in awe or feeling so happy that i just watched it. it just felt mediocre to me.
what about thor, how did you feel about that?
i felt good about movie. it's more like real life. the characters are more like real life not animated like pokemon the first movie. so so, yeah so much action , good for receival. yeah, i liked it.
what do you like about super hero movies?
i like about superhero movies is they bring out the good versus evil. they want to look for the good person in the movie, good people in the movie. just action, suspense leaves you on the edge of the seat because you want to know how it ends. you want to know, if the good guys beat the bad guys or whether the result's for real.
yeah, so i like the action.
gotcha. thank you
see you later
hello. can you tell me, what type of movies do you like?
i really like thriller movies.
ok. great. why do you like thrillers?
they make you think through it all.
can you tell me the title of one of your favorite movies?
i really liked the loft.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you like?
it has a lot of back and forth action that's going on that you really aren't ready for, and it just kind of hits you.
do you like movies like the matrix?
i love the matrix.
what about movies like alien?
alien's pretty good. i like alien, too.

do you like movies like the godfather?

until next time
what kinds of movies do you typically enjoy?
i typically enjoy a lot of documentaries. and i also like mostly comedies. some thrillers are not that bad. and a little bit of drama.
what do you like about those kinds of movies?
how the the writers put into the storylines and i also like
like especially with documentaries, i like the detail that they go into. the ability to get different perspectives of the people involved. and in actual movies, besides documentaries, the characters being, you know, driven emotionally and physically, sometimes, in certain movies.
and just how far some characters can be pushed such as like in the terminator, the rocky movies are cool.
they're kind of inspirational, so that's about it.
i see. so tell me about the terminator. what did you think about it specifically?
oh, the whole the only one that i i didn't really get into was genesis because they made john carter come back and go and go into the future and then go into another time and things just changed around too much, but terminator 1 was really good cuz they introduced him as a hero, as a bad guy and then terminator 2 he kind of turned into a good guy and just the the the like the technology they used, how futuristic it was was really cool
yeah.
great, and do you generally like sci-fi movies like that?
yeah. i mean, it it just depends. like i like spawn.
armageddon was all right. you know, movies with sylvester stallone, arnold schwarzenegger are pretty good. jumper, that was a good movie.
i see. and what kinds of movies do you tend to dislike or avoid?
i don't like some family movies. i don't like there's a lot of animated movies that i wasn't impressed by besides like avatar, that was okay. toy story was good.
some certain movies that have cell shade, i kind of don't really like that a lot. it's it's not interesting to see that
and some of the newer adam sandler movies are kind of not as good as they used to be so
some comedy movies aren't as funny as they were.
what is cell shading?
so, shading is kind of like it's a certain style of animation, then it's like a filtering process of like if you look at the video game 13 or at the movie a scanner darkly. that will mean that that the story telling in that one is pretty good. it's just it's the cell shade style of directing of animation is not i just don't find it appealing.
it looks like there's polygons over people's faces.
so, it's like a kind of texture.
i see. and what's a movie you've seen that you really didn't like?
i guess i'd say ghost fighter 2 cuz they really didn't really didn't let him talk the story of it wasn't as good as the first.
it kind of just it it didn't expand on
like emotionally and what was going on and what he was going through so as much as first.
totally, could have been a lot better.
i see do you dilsike that kind of movie?
yeah, those types of movies are just. i mean they could rewrite them better or write them better.
great, thank you. now i'm curious. did you see dr. strange?
yep.
i saw bits and pieces of it. that one actually seemed to be okay. i just i haven't gotten around to watch a lot of movies like that. seen deadpool. deadpool was pretty good. i like the mixture of comedy. it actually had a story to it. and you know, it was it was violence that was well-accepted, i think. and the overall production was good. but yeah, i have to see doctor strange so

wonderful, thank you for sharing. good bye.
goodbye.
what type of movies do you enjoy?
i love documentaries.
what appeals to you with these type of movies?
that's a great great question, wow. right of the bat, smart guy. hey, i love the fact that they're based in real life. that definitely gives a sense of realism to the film. it makes me feel like i can i can actually go out and change something that was shown in the film, but you probably can honestly. a lot of the documentaries, some of the follow one person's life like bob in the trees, but others just follow like generally like the earth.
i give the planet earth series from the bbc. you have some documentaries that are kind of funny like by louis theroux, and i'm really a big fan of usually any documentary on something i haven't seen before.
is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
oh, totally, yeah. no, totally totally. i'm such a big fan of the movie miami mega jail, it's not such a movie, it's like an hour long documentary, it's sort of movie. it's an hour long documentary by louis theroux and it's fair to say that i'm a really really big fan of his. and it was just so funny because there was the one scene i remember there was this guy
describing to him the fights he would get in in prison. and he's like, we fight for shoes in here. and he's like, i want them shoes. and he asked him if he wants to fight, the host of the presentation, he asked him if he wants to fight, and louie said, "what do you think?" and he just stared at him, and then he got out of there. he he went into the cell with no security. i mean, it was it was it was really really crazy.
are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?
absolutely. absolutely. i totally understand. i really don't like i mentioned a little before, i mentioned i don't like marvel movies, but i also just generally don't like action movies. like i don't know if transformers i don't think transformers is a marvel movie, but i really just don't like that general like action and action type movie. it's just so like it's not plot driven at all. there's no internal
values driving anything. and i totally understand that's fine for some people and some people love that and get enjoyment out of it, but i'm just not one of those kind of people. like michael bay films just never work for me.
is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?
yeah i would say i would say like fast and furious 2 especially in the later later fast and furious films. fast and furious maybe 3, i really didn't like that one. again, probably i don't even know why i watched it, i had a girl over and like she wanted to see it, i'm like, all right. but it was such a bad movie, you know.
have you seen supersize me
i have. i love that film. that's such a good film, wow. wow. i love yeah, i love that it's just another spurlock documentary. he's been really good. i think that's his most famous one though, but he's been really good, especially after that. he's done a lot of good things, as well.
thank you for your help and have a wonderful day!
take care.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like science fiction movies.
why do you like those kinds of movies?
i think they're very different from traditional movies, and i find them to be very interesting.
i see. can you name a particular movie you like?
a particular movie that i like is aliens.
what did you like about aliens?
i really liked how it is different from how traditional nonscience fiction movies are, where there are different features and different uses of technology in movies like the aliens.
gotcha. can you tell me a movie you did not like?
a movie that i did not like.
i think a movie that i didn't like was twilight.
how come you did not like twilight?
i felt like i had an expectation of how the movie was going to be based on reading the books, but it did not really translate to the movie, so i didn't find myself enjoying it as much as i thought i might have.
i see. how do you feel about super hero movies?
i enjoy super hero movies. i think that in the past i didn't, but with the more recent super hero movies they have been pretty entertaining and exciting to watch.
did you like green lantern?
i felt like green lantern was not as good as some of the other super hero movies, but it was not bad either.
i see. thanks for your input today.
what type of movies do you like?
i really like action movies.
why is that?
usually the scenes are really exciting, and there's a lot of cool action stunts and just really cool characters, and you don't really have to dive too deep into the message of the movie. you just it's just a lot of fun.
what is one of your favorite movies?
i really like crank with jason statham, a lot of fun scenes there and just nonstop action the entire time.
what type of movies do you not like?
i really don't like romance movies or like too deep. i just like to sit back and just watch fun themes rather than brewing a lot of emotions and overthinking it.
have you seen the movie inception?
i have seen inception. inception was pretty good.
what did you like about this kind of movie?
have you seen the movie pulp fiction?
i have seen pulp fiction. it's classic. lots of great lines there, and just really great movie.
okay. thank you
thank you.
in general what kinds of movies do you like to watch?
i really like romantic comedies.
why is that?
they are sort of fun and happy movies. they have a happy ending. they make you laugh, usually. they're heartwarming,
sort of more of a more of a good natured, so you're not like depressed or anything watching it. it's it's rarely like a sad film. it's usually just something that will make you feel good.
i see. is there a particular movie like that you remember?
yes. sleepless in seattle's one of my favorite movies.
can you tell me the things about that type of movie you remember liking?
sure. sleepless in seattle is fantastic, especially because of the actors and the writing. the actors are at this point considered like legends, and although neither one of them really makes this kind of movie anymore, they really were the best at it for well over a decade. and the writing is clever and heartwarming and relatable,
so it all really worked to make really funny films that you can watch. i still even though that movie's 25 years old, i still watch it almost every year.
got it! sounds great. ok, now i am going to ask you about a movie in particular, ok?
yes, okay.
have you seen harry potter and the goblet of fire
no, i have not. i haven't seen any of the harry potter movies.
have you seen interstellar
no, i don't even know which one that is.
avengers: age of ultron
yes.
that's a good movie. it is it's a superhero movie and but it's a superhero megamovie where a lot of superheroes are in it. it is good. it is entertaining, but it probably has the avengers movies are probably are not my favorite superhero movies, strictly because it's such a large cast of characters. so there's a lot going on
it ends up being longer than i wish it would be. but in general, it's an easy thing to watch, and it's at the very least somewhat enjoyable, if not very enjoyable. sometimes it can be very enjoyable.
i see. what else about that type of movie did you not like in particular?
you know, i really just don't like i think the length. it doesn't feel as sort of tight and edited as the better superhero movies are. it just feels like it it's sort of going on. and also that one, the first one too, they can get a little complicated. you know, i think they're trying to offer something completely different, and sometimes it's just not the most simple story line,
and it works against the movie being more enjoyable
all right. interesting. are there types of movies you don't like? if so, tell me what about those types you don't like?
sure. i don't like horror movies. i just don't like scaring myself and got so going to a horror movie is certainly going to do that. i know it's fake and for me to sort of get through it i have to almost tell myself that it's fake which defeats the purpose of going. most people who like horror films like being scared so i i don't like being scared. it can cause me to have nightmares. so it's just the kind of movie i avoid and it's not something i enjoy.
ok. i can understand that.
hello. can you tell me, what type of movies do you like?
i like action movies.
ok. great. why do you like action?
i like the high activity, how it's, like, fast and furious, how it, like, always is a go, go, go and the action and direction is cool
can you tell me the title of one of your favorite movies?
fast and the furious

do you like movies like the matrix?
yes.
what type of movies do you not like?
i don't like romantic comedies.

i generally like documentary movies.

i like that they're informative and that they allow me to learn while i'm i i like that i can learn without totally tying myself up with something or
i like that i can learn without tying myself up, so that i can do something else.
i really enjoyed the i don't remember what it was called, but the minecraft about or the documentary about minecraft was really good
we are kind of focusing on the guy who created it. what he was doing shortly before, how he created minecraft, the other people that helped him all that. that was that was really cool movie for me.
i don't like horror movies.
and particularly, i don't like them because i usually find them to be cliché, predictable, and i i don't know. i don't i don't really enjoy being scared. i already have a lot of anxiety as it is. and while they don't typically scare me, i just i don't like feeling like my anxiety is amplified for the sake of of entertainment.
ok, would you say the plot is typically not good in horror movies?
yeah, generally speaking. i mean, there might be exceptions, but since i don't watch a lot of them, a lot of what i can base my information on is
over played story lines in those types of movies, you know?
some bad thing is going after some unsuspecting person. unsuspecting person traps themselves unintentionally in an enclosed space with this thing. you know, they get killed. rinse, repeat, until they finally figure out how to beat it or escape. and yeah, it's just
got it, can you name a particular movie you didn't like? it doesn't have to be horror but it can be.
i don't remember what the last saw movie was. i think that i saw it was like four or five. it was just i didn't really care for that. just cuz, like, i like the saw movies, i got into it when it first came out. it was really cool cuz it was like
hey, here's a movie that's centered around not not necessarily scary like somethings watching me or hunting me, but like people stuck in these crazy fortress positions. i thought it was kind of cool but by like the fifth one, it just started to get stale. it was like you know, it was like any other horror movie. it just went completely over the top, but instead of over the top cliche
instead of over the top cliché
you know, still basically the same tired plot. people are trapped in a room, they have to decide to torture themselves or they won't get out. and i think it just became, "oh, we're just going to torture them anyways.
you know, i just yeah, i didn't really care much for it.
hello
what kind of movies do you like?
i really really like horror movies. they're my favorite genre.
why do you like horror movies?
i like horror movies because i like to be scared, but i don't like being in danger, so it gives me that feeling and the adrenaline of being scared without actually being in any sort of danger in real life.
i see. can you name a particular movie you like?
i just went and saw the nun at the movies the other night, and i really liked that movie.
cool! what did you like about that movie?
i liked the story behind it. i really like scary like religious demonic type of movies, and i also liked that it had a lot of jump scares. it kept me scared the whole time, and the visuals in it were really good, too.

i didn't like any of the die hard movies or the actiony movies like that, i don't like.
how come you did not like them?
i don't really like action movies. my husband watches them all the time, and i just can never get into them. i don't like watching guys shooting at each other. it just never has captured my interest.
gotcha. how do you feel about marvel movies, like thor?
i'm not a big fan of marvel movies. i've never really liked the superhero stuff. i will watch them once, like because my husband might want to, and sometimes there's really good visuals, but i'm not a big fan of the story lines.
is it just the story line, or is there other things you dislike?

yeah. i like movies like star wars a lot. i like sci-fi movies in general.

i think it's neat getting to see all the creative ways people come up with to use technology and just the different ideas they have about what could happen in the future.

comedy movies particularly
can't think of any off the top of my head now.

and it was funny.
yeah, it was enjoyable to watch.
can you tell me what types of movies you like?
i like dramas quite a bit.
ok, what about dramas do you like?
usually the story, they're interesting. and it's easy to get involved with them. just cuz it's an important story, it's not just mindless action or just something that doesn't matter.
got it, can you name a specific film you enjoyed?
shawshank redemption was really good.
what about shawshank redemption did you like?
ok, can you please tell me what genres of movies you don't like?

what about war movies don't you like?
i just generally don't think they're that interesting. there's a couple exceptions. like i really like saving private ryan. but most of the other ones i've seen just aren't that interesting. and it just they all kind of blend together and feel the same. and i just never get attached to anything that's going on.
ok, can you name a film you didn't like? it doesn't have to be a war movie but it can be
what kind of movies do you watch?
i really like teen movies.
do you have a favorite teen movie?
my favorite is probably she's the man.
what did you like about that movie?
it's actually it's it's really fun to watch. it is actually a take off of a shakespeare novel, and so the lead character is undercover impersonating her twin brother, and basically falls in love with another student who doesn't know that she's posing as a guy. and it's just a lot of fun. the actors are extremely likable.
at the time, they were somewhat unknown. amanda bynes, who was the star, was not unknown, but the male lead, channing tatum was very unknown at the time, who's now a superstar. and it's just it's it's a lot of fun. the friends are a lot of fun. it's just sort of entertaining and sort of harmless fun, i guess.
do you like the movie she's all that?
i do like the movie she's all that.
what kind of movies do you not like?
for the most part i don't like scary movies or like horror movies. some sci-fi doesn't work for me.
what do you not like about sci-fi movies?
i don't dislike all sci-fi movies, but it's kind of particular which ones i like. i think the storylines can get very very complicated in a way that's almost unnecessary, like they should channel their focus more into one aspect or three aspects instead of you know, trying to tackle 20. and then sometimes i think about sci-fi, it's just you have to really stick the landing in the movie and
if you don't, it's like a really it just doesn't come off well. so because it's such a it's sort of a concept movie where it's not it's not based in reality, there's a lot going on. when it's lacking, the whole thing falls apart. so if it doesn't come together on almost every way the way other movies don't need to, maybe there's a bad character, a plot point that doesn't really make sense, but it's no big deal. in sci-fi, it has to all work
in order for it all to make sense and for the movie to be good, because already you're all in a alternate reality.
what movie did you last watch that was disappointing?
any movie? i mean, last i could tell you a sci fi movie that's disappointing is thirteenth floor. that's terrible.
but if you're talking about any movie in general that was bad i recently watched a good day to die hard and that was not good.
have you seen ant man?
i have.
did you like or dislike that movie?
i liked the ant man. it was surprisingly good.
what was one thing that made you like the film?
the lead actor paul rudd is fantastic in it. it's really suits him.
have you seen searching?
no.
have you seen aladdin?
yes.
what is something you did not like about that movie?
aladdin's a good movie. i guess
i didn't sort of like the villain in aladdin as much as i have in other disney movies, but in general it was a good movie.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like documentaries.
why do you like those type of movies?
cuz they're about things that happen in real life and i'm interested in stuff like that, like, i like non-fiction books for similar to to documentaries.
are there any particular documentaries that you like?
i like documentaries about nature. i also like documentaries about artists, filmmakers, painters, things like that.
is there a specific movie that you liked?
no.
what type of movies do you dislike?
i don't like horror movies.
is there any particular reason why?
cuz they scare me. they they give me bad dreams.

no.
how about jurassic world?
nope, haven't seen that, either.

what kind of movies do you like?
action movies and science fiction based movies i guess.
why do you enjoy this genre and is there a specific film?
i like the world building, and science fiction, and being able to kind of go to a different place in time, or or the imagination that's in it. i like the matrix.
is there a reason why you enjoy that movie?
that combines the science fiction and the action i guess and it's
it does a really good job of storytelling within that.
is there a movie genre you dislike?
i sort of don't like i guess documentaries to an extent cuz
or some documentaries cuz i find them kind off dry and they maybe remind me too much stuff i saw in school.
is there a specific documentary you dislike?
hm.
coming up with names is difficult.
maybe any of the ones i've seen or what the history channel used to show. the very dry black and white footage with the very kind of monotone british announcer guy.
at least, that's what i think of when i think of bad documentaries.
have you seen searching?
no. is that one where it's all on the computer screens?
have you seen the movie jason bourne ?
yes. one of my favorite series.
what makes you enjoy these films?
i like the director, greengrass, and the actor, damon, and i think they're just distilled down to their pure best parts of what an action film spy film is.
have you seen the film frozen?
the disney animated thing? yes.
i don't remember anything but the song, and i think that's just because it was played everywhere or talked about everywhere.
did you enjoy it?
well, i don't remember much about it but
it was all right. i tend to enjoy the disney animated films as much as anyone else. they're kind of hard not to like i guess.
what makes you like them?
they all kind of have the same formula i guess of the underdog or somebody making something right or making a wrong right. and they have good comedy and i'm in music i guess thing's pretty much universal appeal.
see you later

i mean they're just fine and you can laugh and have a good time and the subject matter is light and, you know, it's generally just about see seeing some funny.
is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
well one of them that i think is funny is the movie hot rod.
yeah. it's just it's just so ridiculous, right? so, there is like this crazy fighting between a father and son, and it's really over the top, and silly, and you'll just never even think that would that you would see something like that in a movie, and i'm just laughing thinking about it.

the storyline was really interesting. i loved the characters and character design and the the movie itself like it was all the props and everything was really realistic.
would you mind telling me about the kinds of movies you like?
i like movie i like comic hero movies, i like action movies.
i like terrorist-attack movies.
i like movies about zombies or movies regarding viral infections.
why exactly do you like those?
cuz they are exciting, and you never know what's going to happen when there's a large disaster. or the a zombie movie there is a lot of excitement and you have thousands of zombies some times chasing people, and it's super exciting.

cool, thanks
and what kind of movies do you tend to avoid or dislike?
animation films

it depends on a film, but i like i like films that are more realistic and have more realistic effects.
i see. what's a movie you saw that you disliked?
pulp fiction
why is that?
cuz, i found it very stupid, and i didn't like how it was made. i found out it was unrealistic, and it was and sometimes it was just it wasn't very as funny as many people made it out to be.
i see. i didn't think pulp fiction was supposed to be funny. i thought it was an action flick
yeah, that's that's true. pulp fiction was was a pretty drawn in action flick, but i just was not a fan of it. it was i thought it was more popular and overrated.
i see. does a film being popular make it overrated to you
no. if it if it has the right if it has the the right concepts, and it is enjoyable to me, it doesn't matter to me if it's popular or not. but if it's popular, and yet it has bad reviews, that makes it over overrated. or if there's a lot of people that don't like the film, but it has a high box office, that makes the film kind of overrated.
okay... now i'm curious. did you see the movie inception?
yes, i thought it was very interesting. i liked how it had so many different you couldn't really find it was very confusing to find out what was real and what wasn't real. and you didn't know when it was false or not.
really, that's interesting. why else did you like it?
because of the concept of you're in a dream within a dream.
cool. did you also see batman: dark knight rises?
no, is that a good movie?
i hear good things and bad things about it. i was just curious since it's a gritty action movie and that's what you seem to like

got it, can you tell me have you seen the movie black panther?
no.
how about jurrasic world: fallen kingdom?
yes.
what did you think about that movie?
it was okay. not bad but not good.
what kind of movies do you like? any specific genre?
comedies are one of my favorites.
is there a movie you can name that you really liked?
sure. best in show is one of my all-time favorite movies.
don't think i've seen it. and can you tell me what you liked about those types of movies?
sure, that is a best in show as a mockumentary style movie and it is from christopher guest, his other ones are fantastic as well like waiting for guffman. and they are all sort of trying to stay true to what they are in mocking but also trying to have a comedic turn. so, this one is a dog show and is just hilarious it is it does really
as like the westminster dog show, but with the humor attached in of all the owners and the dogs and the people running it, and how serious it is, and just it's hilarious. it's sort of the there are movies that have like a cult following. the acting is fantastic. there's a lot of improvisation with the script. it's much more original than a typical movie. but they're fantastic movies.
sounds funny! i'll add it to my movie queue. okay google, add best in show to my movie queue. done.
you should
perfect, now that i know what movie you like, can you name one you don't like? what would be last on your list?
like dude, where's my car?, that was terrible.
what about that kind of movie didn't you like?
it's a comedy and it knows it's dumb, but it's too dumb. so it's the the script is limited at best, where they're saying you know, "dude, dude, dude." constantly, and it's just it's sort of like in the vein of like a dumb and dumber or bill and ted's excellent adventure. it's like you know what they're going for, but it's just too dumb. the other two are too dumb for me, too. just very simple and not
harmful and you can actually watch it, but it's just not a good time. it's just it's just so simple and really when you look back the actors that are in it are too good for that kind of sort of simplistic scripts.
you don't like quantity of laughs over quality of laughs. does that sound right?
it does.
perfect. by any chance have you seen thor? it's action adventure with some comedy.
i absolutely have seen thor.
did you like it?
yes, i really like thor.
what did you like about it?
it is the action is good. the you know, the lore that they're creating is interesting. the romance between thor and jane is very good, and it has lighthearted moments, like you said, and those really work, and they do work to sort of break up the different moments of there's parts in jane's life that are a little lighthearted, and parts in thor's life with his
his friend, so there's there's definitely it's a good balance.
chris hemsworth who plays thor is pretty gorgeous as well.
it doesn't hurt, he really is gorgeous.
have you seen wonder woman? similar, but not as funny.
i have not seen wonder woman yet, but i expect to like it when i do.
and i didn't think it would be that funny but it's okay i do like action adventure quite a bit.
have you seen bridesmaids? it's not action, but it is pretty funny.
i i have definitely seen bridesmaids and i love bridesmaids.
and why's that?
it is a very funny movie, really well written, the execution of it is top notch, it was well cast. at the time the entire cast was not like a famous cast, but they were really perfect for their roles, so it really worked and they really worked together. and it was definitely at the time, it was definitely a little more original that they were taking that they were doing that kind of movie
women, so that was nice. but, it's just a it's a good time. it's a you definitely laugh quite a bit, and you just i think you come away liking everybody in it.

i love the action, i love the story, i love the characters. it was funny and a fun ride.
what kind of movies do you like?
i really like teen movies.
what is it about teen movies do you like?
teen movies, especially the ones that i like, are usually like mini romantic comedies or mini comedies. so almost always they're comedies, and because they're high school based, they are or high school age based, it's a simpler time in almost everybody's life, so the movie is very focused, and it's much more contained, and it's in some ways easier to get right, so there are a decent number
of good ones for that time period. it's they're usually fun. they're usually easy to watch. they're usually lighthearted and funny, so it really works on all around.
well, which teen movie did you like?
10 things i hate about you is one of my favorites.
what is it about that movie did you like?
10 things i hate about you is actually a more sort of deeper teen movie than it's typical, which is good. so, they they it's actually based of a shakespeare's play. so, it has a little more to go with it. the writing of the movie is really good, very funny, both appealing to sort of younger and a little bit older. and the acting was
across the board. at the time that the the actors were known to people like me who were younger and followed who had seen a few movies with some of these people in it, but later on, almost every one of the people in this movie has become a huge star.
ok, well how about a movie you did not like?
i didn't really care for superbad.
what is it about superbad did you not like?
superbad was sort of a it was a comedy. it was a teen comedy that was fairly height as being great and you saw turner commercials for it and everything and upon seeing it it was really a lock down. i think the funniest lines were literally in the commercials and that's what it had in it. it had a couple of funny lines. i think the the overall there we funny things in it but as a cohesive movie it didn't work so it was not
all funny, it just had a couple funny lines in it. it had good actors, but they weren't used all that great. it was a very stilted and extremely despite being a teen movie, they don't usually come off quite as juvenile. this came off juvenile.
wow, ok, have you then seen harry potter and the half-blood prince?
no. i haven't seen harry porter movies.
have you heard of them?
oh absolutely.
yes. i have heard of them.
would you want to see harry potter and the half-blood prince?
no, not particularly.
have you seen then ready player one
yes.
what is it about ready player one did you like or dislike?
i like that it is a good mythology, so it's based of of a book. so, i really like movies that are based of of books. it is a good way to it's a good base to build the movie of of because sometimes a story a script can me underwhelming in that end and a book is always going to have more details than a movie so
there's a lot to build off of. so in that way, i think it worked. it is not my favorite movie, but i like what steven spielberg was going for. it has a good deal of fantasy and imagery in it, so it worked. it was it was very well directed, it just wasn't my favorite content. but i never i didn't go into it expecting to love it.
so you like kinds of movies base off of books?
i do.
ok, thank you for sharing
have a nice day
no problem. thanks. you, too.

exactly. exactly.
i see. can you tell me a movie you really like?

i haven't seen that one. what did you like about it?

ok. now, tell me about the types of movies you don't like.
types of movies i don't like. i don't like movies like the jackass movies, not my cup of tea.
i see. are there any other types of movies you don't enjoy as much?

yeah. i've seen all of them.
what about star wars did you like or dislike?

i don't remember what the exact premise of the movie is, but i i did like superbad. i thought it was really funny and original.
ok. what is it about this type of movie that you like?
with superbad, it was just the ridiculous humor, the irreverent jokes, and just something that was sort of plausible but not really. it just took it took something that was kind of plausible, the whole premise of the movie, and then went way over the top with it and made it just kind of crazy.
do you like movies like thor?
oh yeah, i love superhero movies. haven't seen a really bad one, although suicide squad wasn't very good, but it wasn't super it wasn't bad. it was but the marvel movies are i loved all of those. especially the thor part of the series.
do you like movies like the hunger games?
i enjoyed the first hunger games a lot. the second one was pretty good, but then when they split the book up into two sections, the the third and fourth one just kind of was so slow to me. i mean i went i went and saw them, but they weren't nowhere near as good as the first two. just like splitting that last movie up just kind of really ruined the franchise.
can you say a little more about that please?
i don't know. i mean, i just didn't like the i like the hunger games, but i didn't like the way it was presented the last two movies, split up like that. it just wasn't very good. i liked the first two though a lot, especially the first one. the first one was really good and stayed true to the book, but the third and then the fourth one just wasn't very good.
thank you.

what kind of movies to you like, and why do you like this type of movie?
i like action movies that are relevant today.
can you name a particular movie that you like?
guardians of the galaxy. that one was out a few years ago, but i was disappointed with the ending.
can you give me a couple of reasons why you like this movie?
it has it has modern actors in it so it's kind of a new age action movie, but i'm looking forward to newer movies that are coming out.
can you name a movie that you do not like?
i didn't like the ending to guardians of the galaxy.
they gave up on saving the world or saving the galaxy or so it seemed even though they saved it. they saved the galaxy at the end of the movie, but the theme of the story was that
was that it was it was a joke, and they didn't actually save the universe.
can you name a movie that you do not like?
guardians of the galaxy
i thought you like this movie but not its ending
yes.
i didn't like the theme of the movie. so, it was enjoyable because of the actors and the story.
but the theme of the story and the moral behind the ending of it. it wasn't that great. so it was enjoyable at first, but it turned out to be a movie i wouldn't watch again.
can you name another movie, and one that you do not like?
what's the remake to children of the corn? i couldn't even watch that movie. it isn't the same.
what is it about this movie that you dislike?
it's a rehash of the old movie, and it wasn't as exciting. i guess i'm not involved in the world as much as i was when i was a kid. people paid more attention, so when you see a movie that comes out, you're already in it.
and it just isn't the same today.
you're waiting and waiting for a call, and you secretly make some movies, and you think they're relevant, but they aren't. so it was not an enjoyable movie.
do you like the movie the shape of water?
i haven't seen it.
do you like the movie star wars?
sort of
but i don't know anything about it.
do you like the movie nocturnal animals ?
i haven't heard of it.

do you like the movie the drop?
it doesn't sound that great. i haven't heard of it though.
do you like the movie star wars?
who doesn't? the remakes are trailing off a little bit.
what do you like or dislike about this movie?
i dislike that it's trailing off.
i didn't feel it when when the new ones came out and i'm sure there's still more, but
it doesn't permeate culture as much as it should, or at least my culture.
can you give a couple of reasons why you like or dislike this kind of movie?
it doesn't permeate culture as much as i think it should.
there's no involvement in the movies so we're left as watchers that don't really have a role and
in viewing the movies
at least in my culture
so, it's boring. it's very boring. comedy acts seen to be very good, but there's no real modern good comedy acts. if you want to see anything that's quality, it's probably aged and that's kind of no no, i don't like the modern movies. aren't good anymore.
and the older movies we're encouraged to watch older movies, but they don't get the respect they were supposed to get.
does that make sense.
what kind of movies to you like, and why do you like this type of movie?
i like sci-fi or fantasy movies because it's a escape, and i enjoy settings of that that type.
can you name a particular movie that you like?
oh yes, interstellar.
can you give me a couple of reasons why you like this movie? please do not bring up directors, actors or genres.
it has a very good story that with a twist at the end and it uses pseudoscience that we might that might actually be true.
can you name a movie that you do not like?
titanic
can you give me a couple of reasons why you dislike this movie? please do not bring up directors, actors or genres.
i found the love story unnecessary and also some of the acting in in the movie i was was bad. the story was okay but i could do without the other love story.
do you like the movie jurassic world: fallen kingdom ?
yes, i though it was quite action-packed and good. yes, i did.
can you give me a couple of reasons why you like this movie? please do not bring up directors, actors or genres.
it was action-packed, and i like the story line. and and there was a lot of very good special effects that made the the dinosaurs seem real.
do you like the movie justice league ?
i have not seen it, so i don't have an opinion.
do you like the movie elf?
i've not seen elf either.
have you heard of this movie?
yes.
would you go see it?
no.
do you like the movie pacific rim: uprising?
yes.
can you give me a couple of reasons why you like this movie? please do not bring up directors, actors or genres.
it's just mindless fun. the special effects with all the marks, and the fighting, and stuff was really cool. it just it just a mindless fun, action movie. so, i enjoyed it.
do you like the movie ant-man?
i have not seen it.
have you heard of this movie?
yes.
would you go see it?
no.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like action, adventure movies, comedy, like something like like a 21 jump street, 22 jump street. i do like parody movies sometimes, depending on who's in the movie.
documentaries are good, depending on the subject.
drama movies are good.
and i'm pretty i'm pretty into like fantasy story like star wars and star trek movies. those are pretty interesting to me.
i like something with a good narrative, a good storyline, and good character growth.
what do you like about these kinds of movies?
that really depends. like if it's a good actor and i really appreciate their movies i'll watch it. but if if it's like a new actor i'll want to see how the story is. and if the story is good, their growth as a character, the main plot, if it's not a cliche plot
if it's something i'm into since if it's like a trilogy and i've been into it since the first movie, i'll continue to watch it to understand the storyline. and if it's a continuous story that continues within the first two movie that is within first two movies, that really helped me, i'll watch them.
how about the movies that you don't like, can you tell me more about them?
i don't like horror movies or thriller movies at all. those are the two genres that i i will stay away from a lot.
what did you dislike about these genres?
scared of me? most of the time i'm home at night by myself and i get paranoid and if you live in a big house alone, you just don't expect anything and you're like worried that something will happen. stuff like chucky's scared me as a little kid and i still like freaks me out as an adult. i'm not really into clowns cuz they scare me too so i avoid it.
there are some movies are they're like funny movies. like if it's scary movie 1, 2, or 3, i'm like, "okay i'm watching it." cuz it's funny but at the same it's scary but at the same time it's not it is funny.
can you name a movie that you really liked?
a movie that i really like recently or in general?
whatever comes to your mind!
recently, i think i liked avengers: infinity war a lot.
yeah, that's that's the most recent one i liked. in general, there's this movie called the town, has ben affleck. it's a pretty solid movie, and i enjoyed it from start to end. it's probably my most favorite movie. it's up there like my top three favorite movies of all time.
what did you like about these movies?
i liked avengers: infinity war because it's a superhero movie, of course. it had really everything that i enjoyed from the past 10 years of the marvel universe, cuz iron man's my favorite hero in the marvel universe, and then spider-man's next to him. and it was pretty amazing, the storyline was pretty good, it hit your emotional cores when it gets there, and the character growth
what was going on was pretty good, too. the town and i loved it so much because it's like it's a bank heist movie, but it's like really good. it was written really well. and the direction of the from the director was pretty solid. and i enjoyed ben affleck's performance in the entire movie.
cool. can you name a movie that you didn't like at all?
any movie that you didn't like, if you can name it.
i would say venom. it was disappointing. i didn't i'm not going to say i didn't like it. it was just disappointing on what i've seen versus than what i expected.
what did you dislike about it?
i it wasn't what i expected. i expected like a deadpool kind of movie, where you see venom doing his most
bad things like, he's not a hero, he's anti hero, but at the same time the movie made it show like he was a super hero which it was not cuz that's not was the picture was in the comics and that the and when you realize the movie watch the movie and it's just like oh, just a love story and it's something that basically not it was close to what i wanted but it didn't that that's what i really
liked about this movie. like venom is you think about it's just it's way better than the spider-man 3 movie, venom. i just didn't like the way they teased venom in saying, oh look, you can get this anti-hero as a movie, get everybody all high, but then when it comes out, like oh, it's just, you know, it's a love story. like ah.
what kind of movies to you like, and why do you like this type of movie?
i like mysteries and thrillers, just cuz they're exciting and they keep you on the edge of your seat, and they also while you're watching them, you're trying to think of who if it's a murder mystery type thing, it's like who did it and how are they responsible? and it's a neat little kind of like a puzzle while you're watching the movie.
can you name a particular movie that you like?
i like zodiac a lot, if we're talking thrillers.
can you give me a couple of reasons why you like this movie?
it's based on a true story. it's about a serial killer, and it's just really interesting to see the investigation and how they tried to catch him, even though they never ended up catching him. it was neat to see the process the police took and how they tried to go about it and how he evaded getting captured repeatedly.
can you name a movie that you do not like?
epic movie was a really bad movie that i saw in college.
what is it about this movie that you dislike?
humor. it was so bad. it was meant to be like a parody of fantasy movies like lord of the rings cuz those were popular at the time when it came out. it was just so stupid. it wasn't funny at all.
do you like the movie spotlight?
i haven't seen it.
have you seen ant man?
yep.
do you like it or dislike it, and why?
it was all right. i'm not a big comic book movie person but i like paul redwood, so i was all right with it.
do you like the movie mission impossible?
i haven't seen it.
do you like the movie venom?
i haven't seen it.
hello. what type of movies do you like?
i like superhero movies.
why do you like superhero movies?
they have great action great plots.
lots of great cgi, lots of great special effects, lot of humor, lot of life and death, more questions
so do you prefer movies that are more realistic or ficitional?
i like a little of both depending on the mood i'm in. sometimes i like realistic movies, and sometimes i like the other kind. just depend what the mood is, and who i'm with.
what's one of your favorite movies?
i just came back and i saw deadpool. that was a real good one, deadpool 2. it had a lot of fun, lot of black humor. it was pretty good. dark. dark but funny. made me think. and laugh too, though.
did you prefer the first deadpool or the sequel?
i honestly liked the second one better, which kind of shocked me, cuz i loved the first movie, and the second one was a little better the way they played with that team called x-force.
i like cable, too. cable was pretty interesting.
what type of movies do you not like?
well i got to say it's not probably a popular opinion, but i don't like the twilight movies. i tried to watch them with my girlfriend, and the first one was all right, but after a while it becomes too much of a soap opera for me, and i didn't really go for them.
i know they're tremendously popular though.
first one i i liked, and then went downhill after that. seemed like to me the same thing every every movie. they just changed the title after a while.
did you ever finish the series?
no. i think i got to the wedding. i got to the wedding.
i started getting confused when they brought in the werewolf character.
do you like movies like superbad?
i haven't seen superbad yet, i heard that's really funny. a lot of my friends recommended me to try that out. that's something i should try out.
it's definitely a must see. it's very funny and amusing
that'd be a good one to watch over the summer. i'm definitely going to put that on my my list.

the beach
can you give me a couple of reasons why you like this movie?
yeah. it's kind of like action adventure with a little bit of mystery added in and throughout the movie you're just trying to figure out who's committing murders, and it's just super exciting and just a lot under watch and kind of, you know? while you're watching you're just of trying to figure everything out

i did not like justice league.
how come you did not like it?
the special effects were terrible, and the acting was ho hum at best. it just wasn't good.

i thought the movie was okay. it wasn't great. it wasn't terrible. it was just an okay movie.
do you like super hero movies overall?
yes, i do.
what do you like about them?
i like the fantastical concept that superhero movies bring to the big screen.
what kind of movies do you like? any specific genre?
i like science fiction movies for the most part.
sci fi, awesome. is there a movie you can name that you really liked?
i really enjoyed watching blade runner 2049 in theaters.
they served the original one justice! and can you tell me what you liked about those types of movies?
i like the fact that they have very lived-in, well developed worlds, good stories and good characters.
perfect, now that i know what movie you like, can you name one you don't like? what would be last on your list?
i wasn't a very big fan of sharknado for the most part.
what about that kind of movie didn't you like? it was amazing! it won like 25 oscars. kidding.
i found the movie to be just too over the top for my sensibilities. the acting was poor, and i just couldn't enjoy it, for the most part.
you said you liked sci fi, have you seen aliens?
yes, i've seen aliens.
and what did you think?
i though it was a fantastic movie, and i felt it surpassed the original alien movie.
i agree.
what about the matrix? another sci fi classic.
absolutely. matrix is a fantastic movie and absolutely a classic.
awesome. thank you so much for your input! it helps tremendously. i appreciate it. have a great day!
what type of movies do you like and why?
my favorite types of movies are drama, documentary, some action adventure, and a little bit of fantasy mixed in, primarily
can you name a particular movie you like?
i like i like the matrix, the whole the whole trilogy of the matrix because the story there was a little bit of sci fi and it related to real life and just a new perspective.
please give at least 2 reasons why you like that movie.
i like all the matrix movies. the first one was like an entryway into what the matrix is and the story about basically society being a game. and then i mean, just the sci-fi aspects of it it's like fantasy mixed with
i mean, it's it's hard to describe in a way, cuz it's it it was done in a way that was not like anything else before. so on another note, i like the way the characters were created and how they were put in place. it was very good actors that were chosen for the movies.
well then that's that's pretty much it, just an awesome, freaking trilogy.
can you name a particular movie you dislike?
let's see. i didn't really care for for blues or anything like like dirty dancing. i wasn't really
keen on that kind of kind of movie because like those dancing movies and music movies don't really grab me and like high school musical, chicago, stuff like that. i mean chicago was okay. it was i could deal with that one. it was more artsy.
but movies like musical movies that are too cheesy, i can't get into those. and also because it's just it's just too cookie cutter and too mainstream. it needs to have some art to it.
do you like the movie guardians of the galaxy ?
i saw the first one, and i saw a little bit of the second one, but it's it was all right. i'm more i just like the basic superhero movies
please give at least 2 reasons why you like or dislike this movie.
i don't like the inclusion of like comedy and how the comedy was used. i think it should have been more serious. like the original spider-man with tobey maguire was more serious than spider-man: homecoming. even the second one was a little bit more there was some comedy in it that was just not right for that comic style, so
and another reason is, i just didn't like how the story was written for the movie, like expected of the director, and they they could have written it a little bit more based around the comic book instead of how it was.
have you seen the movie halloween ?
i saw the original one, but i didn't see the new one.
although you have not seen the new halloween, have you heard of it?
yes, i've heard of it. and i know jamie lee curtis is back in it.
do you think you would like to see it?
i think down the road, i probably will see it. i'm probably not going to go see it in theaters, but i wouldn't mind seeing that, versus the one that was made by i think rob zombie. that was that was a totally different perspective of it, which i actually did like that one too, so we'll see.
do you like the movie a star is born ?
i haven't seen that.
although you have not seen it, have you heard of it?
i think i have heard of it. i think i've heard of that title, but that's it.
do you think you would like to see it?
probably not. i'd have to look into it a little bit more to see what's it's about stuff so
have you seen the movie pirates of the caribbean: the curse of the black pearl ?
i haven't seen that one.
have you seen the movie the matrix ?
yes, i've seen that. i was just talking about that earlier.
please give at least 2 reasons why you like or dislike this movie.
oh, i like it for the story, how they present the characters, and i also like it because of the way that they talk about civilization and how it was based on you know it was all pre-scripted. reality is not what you think. so they kind of gave a new perspective on the truth of reality and society and stuff.
what kind of movies do you like?
i really like science fiction movies and movies that are stimulating like different worlds and things like that.
why do you like that kind of movie?
because it's out of what's normally possible in the world, so it makes it just different and more interesting. i don't really want to watch anything that's too realistic in a movie. i want to be entertained.
i see. so what are some movies that you avoid?
mostly romance movies, they don't speak to me.
why don't they speak to you?
i find them boring, and just they make me fall asleep. just short to say, there's i can't name any romance movies that ever interested me or made me excited to watch them.
alright well then what have you seen recently?
recently, well, i recently watched rewatched actually back to the future which is actually a classic movie that is high on my list and 1 day i just felt like watching it. that's the most recent one i've watched it, so a very fun movie with a fun storyline.
why do you enjoy that film?
it has good characters, good background, the story is interesting. it has a lot of science fiction elements obviously, and it's it just speaks to me.
i see. thank you so much. are you interested in any upcoming films?
i think i want to go see the new spider-man movie.
why is that?
i liked the character spider-man and again it's a science fiction movie. i really enjoy the the first films of all i've been watching the next ones after that.
great. i'm curious if you've seen batman v superman: dawn of justice
yes. i've seen it. it was horrible.
what did you think?
it was horrible. the story didn't make any sense, and it just felt like there was just combat, and that was it. i can't even tell you what it was about after watching it.

i like fantasy movies and animation movies
what do you like about these genres?

howl's moving castle is one of my favorite movies.
what did you like about it?
i liked the animation, the character design, and the soundtrack is amazing. also, the plot is very fantastical, but there are parts of the movie that i don't quite understand, but it's a really appealing and and eye-catching movie.

i don't like historical movies. and i don't like movies that contain men in skirts, like 300 and pompeii. i always fall asleep in that kind of movies.
what do you dislike about them?

300, i didn't like that movie.
what did you dislike about it?
that it was boring.
and this the the style that it has it's really weird. it's like really dark colors and, i don't know, it just seems boring. and it was boring to me. the plot wasn't interesting, and i wasn't quite sure if it was supposed to be fantasy or historical fiction.

those are great reasons. can you name a specific movie that fits that category, and tell me why you like that type of movie
recently i watched spider-man: into the spider-verse, and it was just amazing because it it's about what happens after the original spider-man retires. 
and all these little other spider-mans, they do the same thing that he does.
thanks for sharing. could you also name a movie that fits one of those categories that you didn't like, and why you didn't like that type of movie
okay. a recent horror film i watched was bird box. i'm not sure you could say it was horror, but there was no point in the story because you never get to see the monster. it was just suspense the whole time. and, i don't know, it was kind of boring.

comedy comedy movies, action movies

can you tell me the name of a particular movie you like?
movie that i particularly like is toy story 3.
what did you like about toy story 3?
it just showed
it just a showed a kid growing up growing up playing with his toys and matured and went to college and he he decided to throw away his toys.
or someone in his family decided to throw away his toys and they all went to a place where they now treat the toys really well so
it just talks about a low point life event turning a low point to a positive point.
it also had a good versus evil type of feel to the movie, like the good people are the toys that andy used to play with, and the bad people were the toys that were secluded from everyone.
i see. what about a movie you did not like?
movie that i don't like was project x. i don't like project x.

thanks
thank you.
hello, can you please name one of your favourite movie?
i'll see, let me think. i really like
wonder woman, it was very good movie.
what is it about this type of movie that you like?
it's a movie about a character that i grew up with. i remember watching wonder woman on television when i was a kid, and i was a big fan of it then, and i'm a big fan of it now.
what else?
i'm just a fan of the genre and
you know, it was a great movie.
had you know it was great filming, great storyline, good characters, good actors
it was all round, you know, a good movie.
ok. now. could you tell the name of a movie that you dislike?
i'm not a big fan of horror movies. i can't think of the name of one in particular. that the one of the remakes, the exorcist.
don't like the genre, and the movies just really don't appeal to me. i mean they may be good movies, but i just don't i can't make myself watch them cuz i just i don't know. they don't scare me, and they may be well done, but i just just the interest is just not there for me. i can't
i can't force myself to watch them.
there are too many other good movies out there to waste my time.
with those types
okay.have you watched the movie the heist ?
no, i haven't seen that. is that that's a comedy, isn't it? had a big cast. i remember seeing the preview i think, but no, i haven't seen the movie.
what about reservoir dogs
yeah, i've seen that i've seen that one a few times. quentin tarantino's one of my favorites and
did you like it
that was the first yeah, it was great. that was the first movie that he actually did, had complete control over. wasn't his first screenplay, but it was
the subject matter is not is not what some wouldn't be for everybody cuz it was kind of you know, it was pretty graphic if you saw it. and lots of blood and killing and maiming and hurting. but i liked it. i enjoyed it. i didn't think it was too much. it was at the time, it was a breath of fresh air. i don't know if you could say that now because you know, it's been kind of done
but it's hard to recapture that initial time, but i think at time it was you know kind of ahead of it's time actually and there have been a lot of imitation since then.
have you watched the movie the godfather ?
yeah, i've seen all three of them. the first two were very good, the third one not so much. was like they were just trying to get a cash grab for that third one
and didn't really put a lot into the content. the first one was fantastic, probably the second a little more than the first, just because i really liked i really enjoyed seeing.
i really enjoyed seeing the you know the origins of don corleone and you know, robert de niro was very good in it.
but overall, i think the first two were fantastic
and the third one was i'm glad i watched it, but it wasn't really good.
hello. i’d like to discuss your movie preferences. ok?
what would you like to know?
i can tell you about the movies that i like. i like action and fantasy films as well as science fiction films.
some of my favorite films include: star wars, the lord of the rings trilogy and the hobbit trilogy.
so you like movie series?
i can't tell you that i don't like low budget films, as i just don't find them very entertaining.
what did you like about the lord of the rings trilogy?
that's a pretty easy question to answer. i like that the lord of the rings trilogy offered an escape from reality. 
it was such a convincing world that it took place in with so much detail and it was such an epic scale that it felt like i was a part of that world and that adventure.
and not many movies are able draw me in to that degree.
can you name a movie you did not like?
i have to think about that for just a second. let me see here.
movies that i did not like. that's an easy one. star wars: the last jedi.
i did not like star wars: the last jedi.
what did u not like about it?
i think it was very poorly written. i think the
people in charge of the movie were more interested in pushing identity politics and the left-wing political agenda and it put that overwriting and creating a good star wars movie and it shows. the movie gives us very shallow characters. it gives us let down after a let down 
and it tries to fundamentally change the core values of the franchise's main characters such as luke skywalker, and it basically insulted as fans and supporters of the franchise in many different ways, whether it's the petty scenes where luke is having to drink milk from the tit of a giant sea cow, or when he throws his beloved father's lightsaber over his shoulder as if it were worth nothing to the
i could go on and on about why i do not like that movie.
is there anything else?
so i'm guessing you read the series as well?
yes. i read the book series. i read almost every single star wars book growing up as a child. well, over 40 books.
did you like the movie ant man?
i did like it, but i wasn't very impressed, and i wasn't very interested by it. while i don't think it's a bad movie, i just didn't particularly enjoy it very much.
what about the movie aladdin?
yes, i liked the movie aladdin.
what did u like about it?
i like the characters such as genie, played by robin williams. he's one of my favorite actors, and i like the art style and the amazing music.
i totally agree about robin williams
his character was the best

funny. it's really an underdog movie. bobby goes from being the worst the worst person in the team to being the top best to being the best player on the team. so, yeah, it's an underdog movie. you feel good, i like it.
so you like the story line?
yep, i like it.
what type of movies do you not like?
a movie that i don't like is a movie that i watched many years ago. it's called project x, because there was no storyline. it just showed pictures it just showed images it showed images of of breast, boobs, ass, didn't really have a developing storyline, so i didn't really like it. i wouldn't i wouldn't go and see it again.

oh, i really like historical and drama movies. like anything that has to do with history.
can u name a movie that fits those categories that u really like
yes, schindler's list.
what qualities of the movie did u like?
it portrays a dramatic story that really happens and it really grips at your emotions and takes you through the the whole suffering of world war ii and the nazis.
thanks for sharing. what is a movie that fits that category that u didn't like?
i wasn't really a big fan of
the shawshank redemption. although it was really good, like it was well reviewed, i just it was too long, and just didn't enjoy it.
what about it just didn't work for u?
i don't think the actors worked well together. in my mind, they clashed. so, it wasn't it just wasn't fun to watch.
got it, thanks for sharing. and this is a bit of a tangent, but have u seen the hobbit
yes.
did u like it?
yes, it was great.
what about it was great
i like the characters, the story line. and how it builds up on lord of the rings and gives you more background and insight into the hobbits and everything else. so, i thought it was a really great movie.
how were the costumes, music, background, etc.?
costumes made me feel like they're real. so, everything is fake, but it was not in the movie. it was like exactly there. and of course, the the movie the music was engrossing, just like lord of the rings. it was majestical, almost, and well composed.
what type of movies do you enjoy?
i enjoy dramas, all kinds, different kinds. you know, sometimes sappy, depends on the kind of mood am in or you know sometimes the heartfelt or serious dramas are fun, too.
i also enjoy the occasional thriller movie.
which is really just a drama with a lot of intensity to it.
what do you enjoy about them?
well, it's like a lot time just kind of just takes you out of your own head for a little while and maybe shows you the life of somebody else and how you know, the struggles they face sometimes and the you know, the different things they do. and just like you know, kind of the a lot of times they're human stories. and usually they're pretty believable you know, not fantasy or or science fiction or anything like that.
it's, you know, stuff you can a lot of time the stuff you can relate to or things that you might wish should happen to you or things that even sometimes maybe have happened to you.
i can see why you would consider it a sort of escape
what specific movie from that genre do you enjoy?
more like forrest gump, but it was kind of a comedy drama. that's probably a classic. that one get's well me every time i watch it.
i don't know. i think i'm looking forward to that lady gaga movie that's coming out tomorrow. i'll probably go see it, a star is born. i like the original one. that was good. i don't know if you consider it if it's a more musical, but it seems like it's got a lot of drama in it. so i'm kind of looking forward to that tomorrow, and unless i get
what interests you about it?
it just the whole music thing behind it, showbiz tale. i don't know. i'm kind of i like bradley cooper, and i'm kind of interested in seeing lady gaga cuz she was in cuz she was really good on american horror story. so it'll be interesting to see how she does in a more dramatic role.
it just looks like a really good movie.
so, i guess i'll be disappointed if it's not.
most definitely, sounds like one aspect is the evolution of her acting
are there any type of movies that you dislike?
i'm not really big on documentaries. i guess occasionally maybe once in a while if it's a really good subject. but, you know, generally it's it's just about a bunch of stuff i don't care about or, you know, they are usually long and kind of often very boring. but i mean if it's something that i'm really passionate about then maybe.
is there a particular movie that you dislike?
not really. just you know, just sort of topics. maybe i'm not a big fan of michael moore movies
i think he's a little too preachy. not any one in specific, but just his general style of filmmaking.
i can see why you wouldn't be interested in those, have you seen the shape of water
i started watching that, but i just couldn't get into it enough to finish it.
i tried. i think only got maybe 30 minutes into it. it's generally the type of movie that i would like, but
what did you not enjoy about it?
i just i just couldn't get into the story. it i don't know and at the time i had a bunch of other movies to watch so
i just didn't watch it and then kind of
i went to something else. i can't remember what i did watch, but it was just moving so slow, i just couldn't couldn't get into it good enough, and then i just never went back and finished it.
i think i might have seen 30 minutes of it. i might not even have been that long. it might have been more like 15. it was just kind of just a little too slow for me.
the pace wasn't fast enough, i can see why it would be a little boring

horror films
so the really scary thrillers, i can do regular thrillers, just not scary thrillers. i stay away from a good deal of sci-fi.

i like the dark knight a lot, the one from 2008 i think.

i see. can you tell me a movie you've seen and didn't like?
i recently saw the movie the black panther. it was okay, but i didn't like it overall. it was way overhyped. i just found the acting to be stilted and not good.

and what about the storyline?
i found the story line to be just okay.
alright.

i see. can you tell me about a movie you didn't like?
i didn't really like black panther.
and what did you not like about that one?
it was just i don't know too weird for me i guess.
ok. can you think of another movie you didn't like?
i didn't really care for the new spider-man. i guess superhero movies don't really do much for me, but yeah, i didn't really like that, either.
too much of a fantasy storyline?
yes, it's just not believable at all.
i see. have you seen ocean's eight?
yes. i had to think about that for a second. yes, and i actually loved all of those movies. they're funny, and they the crime aspect to it is intriguing to me, entertaining.
so you like a bit of mystery mixed with comedy?
definitely.
have you seen the movie tag?
no, i'm not familiar with that one.
i think you'd enjoy the story
what about the matrix, have you seen that one?
more than once
and that's an understatement, probably. yeah, i've seen it quite a few times.
and what do you like about those types of movies?
just the the action and especially in the matrix, kind of the sci-fi behind the story was very cool.
it's a good storyline. and good acting too!
definitely.
do you like movies like star wars?
sure do. i like the fantasy science fiction western mixture, the good guy versus bad guy with the light sabers instead of guns.
awesome. i agree. how about movies like the matrix?
one of my favorites. still every time i go see a movie, especially a science fiction or action movie, i always end up comparing it to the experience i had first time watching the original matrix. the i love there's not anything bad about it that i've ever noticed or seen. it's
twist at the end, the action, the science fiction, it all works for me.
it set the standard for action computer graphics. everything after that had to at least live up that the original matrix.
that's true, it changed a lot of for a long time how action scenes were shot especially with that slow motion 360 cam. now we've kind of gone the opposite where it's like jason bourne movies where everything is so quick cut and you can't tell what's going on. i wish we could go back to the matrix.
what did you think about the hunger games? the action was there, as well as the cgi
i think i only saw the first two hunger games and they were all right. i mean they they were no matrix or anything but i could see myself if it came on cable tv you know, as they say like a rainy saturday afternoon or something. i could watch them again. but i don't own them and
i don't look for to own them anytime soon.
awesome. thank you so much for your input! it's been a huge help!
what kinds of movies do you like?
i really like action movies.
like superhero movies.
why do you like action movies?
they're just really fun, energetic. they make me feel like, you know, i can be an action star, too. see lots of cool stunts, and usually lots of unique and cool locations.
alright, how about a movie you liked?
i really liked transporter.
why did you like that movie?
there's a lot of really cool stunts and a lot of awesome action scenes really like heart pounding excitement.
well, is there a movie you did not like?
that action movie i didn't like. hardcore henry, i didn't like. i really didn't like the first person and it's just seem like a really tough violent for no reason.
ok, then have you seen the movie john wick ?
i have. john wick is awesome.
why did you like john wick?
the story is really good. the characters are awesome, and there's a lot of cool themes in the movie.
ok, thank you for sharing. good bye.
what kinds of movies do you like?
i really racing movies.
well tell me why do you like racing movies?
i like cars in general and i just love the high octane, you know, high pressure situations that the movies are in and there's usually a lot of fun action scenes and, you know, car scenes, couple of explosions. it's just a lot of fun.
alright, how about a movie you liked?
i really like the fast and the furious movies.
why did you like that movie?
tons of interesting cars, lots of fun race scenes
and just general local scenes
interesting, is there a movie you did not like?
i really didn't like need for speed. it was kind of too plain and generic for me.
ok, then have you seen the movie death race?
i have, it's pretty fun.
what kind of movies do you like?
oh, you know, i like all sorts of movies. i like action films and independent films and documentaries, but especially love films by stanley kubrick.
why do you like those kinds of movies?
some of the movies i grew up with, some of them because i didn't grow up with and i wanted to like them. and the ones from directors that i like, i just love the imagery and the tales that the directors tell. yeah.
i see.
can you name a particular movie you like?
full metal jacket
what did you like about that movie?
well, in beginning it has an excellent boot camp scene, half of the movie is like boot camp and it's just intense. and then the second part of it is like that they mentioned it in the film just the duality of man kind of concepts of and also the whole silliness of war almost how stupid it is.
cool.
can you tell me a movie you did not like?
i haven't watched a movie i didn't like in a while. okay, i didn't like the jack ryan movie.
how come you did not like it?
it didn't feel like an actual jack ryan film. and i say the actual jack ryan films referring to the hunt for red october, the patriot games, and other films like that that came out in the '80s and '90s. jack ryan felt really it felt like it wanted to be a bourne film and not which is just straight up action designed for people with short attention spans.
i see. how did you feel about mission impossible?
i don't know. mission: impossible, you know what you're going to get with it because you've got tom cruise in it, and he does know how to make a good action film. but it was really standard hollywood fare.
so it was okay. i kind of liked it.
ok. how about dumb and dumber? how'd you feel about that?
oh, that's a stupid film. i disliked it.
definitely not the kind of movie i i enjoy.
how come you did not like it?
it's it's in the title. it's dumb and dumber. it was a dumb movie. they just that's the kind of movie i walk out on.
how come?
it's not like a smart comedy. it's more designed for it's like movie designed for teenagers, not for adult. it's just stupid.
it's not a thinking film. it doesn't have anything i can think about.
if i don't want to think about something, i meditate.
what kinds of movies do you like?
i like i like all different kinds of movies but sometimes i like to watch boxing movies.
well, tell me why do you like boxing movies?
cuz it's they're usually like people about people overcoming adversity and and then building to like a successful triumph.
cool, what is your favorite movie?
my favorite movie is probably the hustler.
alright, why is that your favorite movie?
it's about it's about guys who gamble while playing pool. and i like to play pool and i think gambling is an interesting subject matter for movies.
interesting, is there a movie you did not like?
movie that i did not like
yeah, i i was not a fan of the incredibles 2.
oh, why not?
i don't know. i think just didn't live up to everything i expected out of the first one. so, the first one i thought was really good and i thought this was going to be kind of like that, but it went in a little bit of a different direction.
ok, then have you seen the movie the equalizer
the equalizer i have not seen the equalizer. what's that about?
have you heard of it?
i i think i've heard the name, but i don't know what it's about.
ok, then have you seen the movie gone girl
gone girl, yes, i saw gone girl.
what is it about this kinds of movies that you like or dislike?
uh, gone girl you know i thought it was i thought it was interesting it kept my attention. it was a really in depth story like it had a lot it had a lot of plot twist and what not but i think that will probably be my criticism to it. it was a little bit it was a little bit too twisty. it had a little bit too many twists and turns in it.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like movies with an art style, good architecture, good music, a unique story line.
ok
can you think of a movie that had that?
yes, i can. grand budapest hotel, inception
ok, inception, what about that kind of movie do you recall liking?
i liked the music, the atmosphere, the architecture, and the story line.
how about the other
i like the music, the storyline, the dialogue, the art.
more specifically, what kind of things do you remember about the art?
i remember the picture being a dim color, like an orange glow to the movie in general. and that was really pleasing.
and the architecture?
the hotel itself, there's a lot of mountains in a unique area that the movie took place in.
great. what kinds of movies do you not like?
i do not like horror movies.
well what is it about horrow you don't like?
i don't like being scared.
can you tell me about the feelings you had?
yes, scared on edge worried about what's going to happen next.
what images did you think made that happen?
images of people dying
oh i see
can you think of a horror film in particular and tell me about yur feeligns?
sure, any of the solo franchise horror movies. i didn't like watching those people die or need to make certain choices to save their life that would hurt them.
you said saw, right?
yes.
ok. thanks so much that is all i need!
what kind of movie do you generally like
i like interesting movies. they could be action or story-driven, science fiction, anything, except romantic movies.
why do you like those type of movies?
they keep my interests and i feel like i can put myself in the movie by imagining it.
can you name a particular movie that fits that category, and describe a bit about why u like that kind of movie
guardians of the galaxy because i really enjoyed it. and the story was compelling, and i liked the characters presented.
nice choice. how about a movie that you didn't necessarily like that fits that category, and why you didn't like that kind of movie
i recently actually went to see the new lego movie and i didn't really enjoy it, it was pretty boring.
thanks for sharing. what about it was boring to you
it seems like they rehashed a storyline like they they didn't really come up with anything new. it was just the same old whereas some sequels are a whole new story that's interesting, this just seemed like a cash grab, as they would say.
ah. i understand. have you heard of the movie deadpool
yes.
have u seen it
no.
how about the matrix
yes, i love that movie.
lovely. what do u like about these kinds of movies
the story line is based upon like the real world, but then it's reinvented to be something that technically is impossible. it really makes you think about your current situation and you know, the future, and just science fiction in general is very compelling and interesting.
what are some kinds of movies you like?
one of my favorite kinds is action movies.
why's that?
they're the action is a lot of fun. even though it's it's not something that you want to see in real life. it's a ton of fun on screen. they tend to be like sort of like non-stop, start to finish or great escape. and, usually if the story is good in good action movie the story is descent so if somebody getting saved
skewed or they are on some mission to help a country or whatever the case may be and it's usually something you can root for so it's a good time.
that's great. what other kinds of movies do you like?
i also like like similar to action movies, i also like superhero movies, which are a little bit different than action movies, but i do like those as well.
i see. what's a movie you've seen that you really liked
one of my favorite action movies is definitely mr. & mrs. smith.
what's so good about it that it's your favorite?
that's one that has excellent cast, really great acting, and it's one that pairs action and comedy really well. some all the great things that you get of action movie, you know, the action, the whatever, the fighting, that those kinds of scenes that are very exciting, but also they do such a great job with the comedy. so, it's a really entertaining movie from start to finish. but
it's not all highly charged. there's a there's a a lot of levity, a lot of laughter, throughout.
that sounds fun! now, switching gears, what kinds of movies do you dislike?
i don't really like sci-fi movies.
why not? aren't they very popular?
sci-fi movies are very popular. for me, sci-fi can be a little too high concept. and it's not always well thought out or well executed. there's a lot of times where i watch a sci-fi, and i'll think this doesn't make much sense. and so, it's hard to like something when it doesn't really sort of carry through on whatever claim it's making in the beginning. sci-fi really struggles with that. so, if they do it well
okay, that's pretty reasonable. so what's a movie you've seen that you disliked?
like the thirteenth floor was not a good one. that's one where the concept like till this day i still don't understand what they were trying to do. so it was interesting, it was a very good cast, it was a well acted movie, but the concept and what they were going for was so confusing. and it wasn't confusing the entire
movie, but it was confusing probably midway through till the end so that when you're done with the movie, you're looking at the person next you thinking do you understand what just happened cuz i did i don't i didn't get it. and and that's one where i've talked to other people who saw and they're like i didn't get it either. so, it's just the confusion that comes with sci-fi. it ends up not being the best movie going experience because i guess it does great conversation, but it's not great to
our conversation when we're all wondering what they were trying to go for, cuz they didn't pull it off very well.
so it's important for you to get movies so you can talk about them afterwords?
it's good if you can talk about them afterwards, but it is just important to get it, so that it's sort of a satisfying movie-going experience, rather than a confusing one. you want to go to the movies, enjoy it, and be happy you went, instead of thinking, "i could've stayed home for all that.
i see. now i"m curious if you have seen or heard of avengers age of ultron
i have not seen it, but i have heard of it. it's one that i would watch. i've watched avengers movies before. like i said, i do like superhero movies. but the avengers movies are not my favorite. they have so many characters, and so much going on, that while it can be mostly entertaining, it's usually just a lot it's just a lot going on. and it's just it's okay. it's just not my first choice.
i see. thank you.
you're welcome.
i've got one more question if that's okay?
sure.
have you seen or heard of holmes and watson?
yes. i have as long as i have the second movie in the series. yes, i've seen it.
i didn't know it was a series. what did you think of it?
it wasn't as good as the first one, but in general it's a really good paring between robert downey jr. and jude law, that really works. and he's a great as sherlock holmes, and it has a good feel for it. the comedic tone is great. the i would say the biggest problem with the movie in general is just it's script isn't as good as the first one. so, maybe they need
like take more time to really come up with a good story that presents well on-screen. but you can still come away liking the movie because the characters are enjoyable.
what type of movies do you like?
i like crime-drama movies.
whys that?
i just like the stories. i like the action that comes from them. i like the i guess i like the criminal elements.
what is one of your favorite movies?
godfather
why the godfather? because it's a classic?
yeah, that's a good reason. it's a it's a classic movie. it's
i mean, there's still many great things about it. it has great acting, there's great writing, good great directing.
can you name me a movie you didn't like?
a movie i don't like i don't like a lot of chick flicks. i don't like
see i don't like the movie
how about
freaky friday
why?
i just don't really care too much for the subject.
i i i think that they're unnecessary movies. they're usually not not funny and they don't really have good stories.
okay. have you heard of the movie coco?
i don't think so.
what about the movie star wars?
the first one, there's a lot of i like the whole pretty much almost all of the star wars movies that
so i'm guessing you're a big fan?
yeah, i'm a fan of star wars.
what do you think of the newer movies?
i think that they are not as good as the originals, but better than the one of them that was made in the early 2000's. the prequel, i guess. they are better than the prequels.
okay. thanks
what kind of movies do you like?
oh, i really enjoy a good sports movie.
what do you enjoy about them?
i like the the sports factor. makes it feel relatable and more real to me. i guess i can put myself in the characters better.
can you name a movie that you really liked?
yeah. have you ever watched rocky?
it's about a small-time boxer from philadelphia, which is in the area that i live, that that goes to be world champion. pretty much a rags-to-riches story.
nice. what did you like about it?
it felt realistic. they used scenery that's familiar to me. it was also not too heavy on technicalities. like it really had a good story, and the boxing was well put together. in the the movie, it felt real.
how about movies that you don't like, can you tell me more about them?
i don't particularly like romance movies. they bore me to death.
why is that?
i just don't like the story lines in them, and they just don't hold my attention for a long time. they just they're just boring to me.
can you name a movie that you didn't like?
if i think of that sports movie, it was a really bad movie called blades of glory which was with
two ice skater are competing. it was supposed to be a comedy. it was really bad. it was with will ferrell, who is usually a good actor. but it just was stupid.
what did you dislike about this movie?
it it felt it felt more like comedy not a sports movie, and it wasn't really realistic. and watching two guys ride around the ice in tight spandex wasn't my idea of a good time.
have you seen die hard?
oh yeah, i've seen die hard. i think everybody's seen die hard. it's a christmas tradition almost and yeah, i've seen it.

i don't like horror movies, and i don't like drama movies.
why do you not like horror movies?
i find they're often too predictable and too cliche. usually, the plots are really similar which is that there is something scary, nobody knows about it, but it's killing people or terrorizing people or something. and then they figure it and they usually they end up beating it or locking it away or whatever it is that ends up happening to it.
what kind of movies do you like the most?
it's a toss-up between comedy and war movies.
what was the last movie that you watched that disappointed you
deadpool
what didnt you like about deadpool?
i just didn't really find it all that funny. it felt a bit overrated to me. people made a much bigger deal about it than than i thought it was worth. i also don't really get into the whole comic book thing, anyways.

no, i have not.
have you seen fight club?
no, i haven't.
have you seen pulp fiction?
yes, i did not like that movie.

thank you for your input, have a nice day
thank you.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like science fiction movies.
why do you like those kinds of movies?
i don't know, because they're very imaginative and

explore different parts of the mind, and conscience, and reality that we really haven't never experienced before, and they're very entertaining.
my favorite movie would be friday the 13th.
what did you like about that movie?
character creation the main character of the movie, jason bohis, is a i don't know. he is a very recent character and he kills a lot of people in the movie and, i enjoyed it so much. i bet i'd watch that movie 150 times. i mean i really loved that movie, and i loved everything about it. i liked the part with the girls, at the camp, he is always trying to get them and the counselors
it's goes on and on.
i see can you tell me a movie you did not like?
well, a movie i don't like? i don't like star trek. i really don't like star trek. it's one of the worst movies ever made.
how come you did not like it?

did you like wonder woman?
yes, wonder woman was very good. i love wonder woman, its one of the top movies last year.
do you like super hero movies?
yes, i love superhero movies.
i sure do.

thank you for your input
what kind of movies do you like?
thrillers, action, political thrillers, action movies like die hard or the matrix, sci-fi movies, things like that.
great. can you give me a movie you really liked?
well, let's go with the matrix.
what did you like about it?
i liked the it has a lot of the things i like in it. action, has a pretty heavy sci-fi bent to it. there's just a little bit of religious subtext. but mostly it's the action and the storytelling i thought were very good.
okay
now can you give me a movie you didn't like?
recently or any time?
anytime
let's go with i think it's called spartan. and it's my least favorite movie of seeing. it's by david mamet who i had normally kind of like, but he the movie is just preposterous and badly written and it made me laugh. when i watched genre, it's meant it's not a comedy. it's the only movie i've ever done that.
got it
well yeah.
did you like night school?
i didn't see it. i probably would be fine with it. i don't know how how much i would like it, but the trailer look okay.
okay, how about a star is born?
haven't seen it. i like the songs that are in it, only some of them that i've listened to.
okay, how about black panther?
i liked it. i don't think i didn't like it as much as everybody else, apparently. but i thought it was right up there with the rest of the marvel movies.
is there something particular about this type of movie you like?
about black panther? probably just what everybody else would like the action. it's character it's i will give it credit in that it is a different because of centered around a black superhero, and it took place in africa, the cultures there and everything that it did feel different in that way.
yes
and i like seeing that on the screen, but and the action of the movie was very very good, as well. except for the last fight. i thought the cgi was not very good. but the rest of the stuff i liked. and i like the characters that they introduced, especially the sister. i thought she was pretty funny and charming.
ok thanks
how about insurgent?
insurgent i don't think i've seen that cuz i'm not sure what it is or i'm not familiar with it.
no problem
how about deadpool?
one or two? i've seen either one, or both of them.
okay, did you like them?
i liked 1 i think a little bit more than 2. i'm not sure if i like three just coz it seems their humor seems to i think it gets old pretty quickly, but it is very much different. and i i like the naked guns movies and the to an extend the scary movies. i like to think 1 and 2 scary movies though i like a little parody
of either movies or a genre of movies, and i think deadpool does a really good job of lampooning super hero movies while also still telling a super hero movie which is very hard thing to do to get that those tunes correct. and i think it does pretty well so but i'm not sure if that kind of immature humor if i'll like it throw that in that
okay. thank you for your time

i like this movie because it was a continuation of of where the first and second movie left left off. it's about a story of it's about a story about a a boy who deserts his toys. he doesn't want to play with his toys anymore. and and all of his toys go back goes back to a go back to a place where it isn't too pleasant, like a day care center.
so overcoming the obstacles and reuniting with and the toys reuniting with the with with its family.
interesting, is there a movie you do not like?
i did not like 101 dalmatians the the movie.
oh, why not?
because i don't really like the characters in it. i didn't really like the topics talking about dogs, and
it was about dogs and something like that and i'm not really a dog person.
ok, then have you seen the movie ice age
ice age, no. i haven't seen that movie.
have you heard of it?
no, i haven't. i've heard of it. yeah, i've heard of ice age before, but i've never seen it.
ok, then have you seen the movie thor: ragnarok
yes, i have seen that movie. i love i like his superpowers and how he's trying to conquer evil, and
wonderful. thank you for sharing. good bye.
hello. can you tell me, what type of movies do you like?
i like action, thrillers, mystery
some horror, maybe.
ok. great. why do you like thrillers?
i don't know. they get the adrenaline pumping and it kind of has a puzzle to it you try to figure out, so those are two things i enjoy, i guess.
and i like story, so they usually have pretty good stories.
do you like the movie gone girl?
yeah. it
i won't say it's one of my favorite movies, but it's i enjoy watching it, and i didn't hate it or anything. and i like that it was it kind of was a different thriller or at least took the tropes of the thriller genre and flipped it a little bit and you weren't really sure what you are watching sometimes.
i see. can you tell me the title of one of your favorite movies?
well, in the same category, i would say seven, which, i think, has the best ending of or one of the best endings of any movie and is one of the better paced movies. it's i anytime it's on it just propels you to finish watching it and also, the story is very engaging, i think.
and it has a little bit of horror aspect to it.
what type of movies do you not like?
maybe well sticking within that kind of horror thriller thing is movies like torture movies, like hostel or i can't think of maybe cabin in the no, not cabin in the woods. cabin fever, is that one? something like that, where but hostel, where people are getting like their bodies mutilated and stuff. i don't like that stuff
okay. thanks
mhm.
hello. what kind of movies do you like?
hi. i really like the comedies and documentaries.
me too. why do you like this kind of movie?
i find both of them entertaining in different ways. i think i really like things that make me laugh. i want to be in a good mood most of the time, and documentaries can be sad, but they're very informative, and i learn a lot about how other people live, so that's why i like those.
can you name a particular documentary that you like?
the one i this one that i really liked was going clear, about scientology. i also really liked thirteen.
what are the 2 things that you like about this movie?
i liked that i learned a lot about systems in the us and how they can oppress people, and the effects that they have on families and really both of them were about people who felt imprisoned in multiple ways, and you could see like how that affects them, and how they it's hard for them to relate to other people.
was this the movie going clear or the movie 13?
actually, honestly both of them. but probably the closest one was 13th, since that is about prison the prison system in the us.
thank you for clarifying. can you name a movie that you do not like?
oh man, i think the movie i hated the most was the man who fell to earth. that's the one that stars david bowie, and it's from the '70s.
what are the 2 things that you dislike about this movie?
number one was way too long and number two the sex scenes were really worrying.
do you like the movie the shape of water?
i've actually never seen it.
do you like the movie the heist?
i haven't seen that one either actually, although i think i probably would like it cuz i tend to like movies about iced about people who get together to steal things.
do you like the movie hunger games?
that i did. i i saw that and i yeah. i really liked it. i thought it had a lot of action in it, and i think jennifer lawrence did a good job as the heroine.
last question: can you give a couple of reasons why you like this movie?
hunger games? i liked it because i liked the i think i think they did a good job of like setting up the world that it was set in. it was very it felt realistic. it felt natural. like i felt the choices people made were natural given the circumstances. the costuming was really great. and i thought the acting was really good. i you know you wouldn't think so with that kind of movie, like it's very it's action-oriented, so they're going to emphasize that more, but i thought the acting was compelling. i think jennifer
thank you for your most insightful feedback. good night.
thank you.
hello. what kind of movies do you like?
i like romantic comedies a lot.
why do you like this kind of movie?
i really love comedies, so i like the aspect that it's you know, funny, lighthearted, but i also love romances, so the combination is great. you basically get a happy ending in all of the movies, and it's usually just a feel good movie. it's a good time, and it's a nice escape.
can you name a particular romantic comedy that you like?
sure, like the holiday is one of my absolute favorites.
what are the 2 things that you like about this movie?
the cast of the movie is fantastic, like couldn't have been better, and it's jude law and cameron diaz and it just it's it's it's so good. and the the the script the storyline of the whole movie is so well done. it's so well written, but it's also it's much more original
than we usually get in a romantic comedy. it has two love stories in it, not one. it has some unexpected heartwarming aspects to it involving other characters, as well. it's just a delight.
can you name a movie that you dislike?
a romantic comedy that i dislike?
thou be true, it's terrible.
what are the 2 things that you dislike about this movie?
it was so part of the problem was how it was billed. it was billed as a romantic comedy. that's how they advertised it, that's how they showed it, and that's how they acted like it was going to be when they started the movie. but it was really more of a gross out comedy, which was kind of popular at the time, i guess. and so you went in expecting a romantic comedy, and you what was really happening was sort of like taking comedy to the extreme in a very
funny and sort of gross out juvenile manner. it was a mess. the second thing i really hate about it really the lead actor. gerard butler is sorely miscast. he just is not good for romantic comedies at all. he doesn't pull off any aspect of what you want out of a romantic he's not like good at lighthearted. he's not funny. and i guess he's good looking, but it doesn't really
it's not like that in a handsome way i guess.
other than the casting of gerald butler, can you name a third reason?
sure. just in general, the movie itself is poorly written. it's like it was
i guess, i think probably trying too hard to be too many things, it certainly wasn't a romantic comedy and it was written in a way that one, i didn't laugh once, and two, the comedy they were going for was a wrong kind of comedy for romantic comedy.
do you like the movie black klansman?
oh, i haven't seen that yet, but that's that's got to be a good one.
do you like the movie spotlight?
i mean it's an excellent film, it's not something that i would re-watch again but it's an important film and really well done.
can you give a couple of reasons why you like this movie?
it is
a really good ensemble cast. sometimes it's hard to do an ensemble movie because there could be weak links throughout the cast, but this is one that is all around solid and the screenplay is exceptional. it is really well written, really well done and really captures the the true story that it was writing about and the
and it pulls off what they were trying to accomplish in terms of capturing the importance of a story that they needed to tell.
do you like the movie jurassic world?
i haven't see it, but i but that kind of movie is okay. i have seen the original jurassic park and jurassic park 2. and i do like the general feel of them, but those can tend to be a bit scary too, so i'm not sure if jurassic world would be good for me, but i would see it.
last question: can you give a couple of reasons why you like this movie?
i like action movies, and it's basically an action movie, so it has that sort of aspect of being exciting and kind of edge of your seat and you know, keeping you going from start to finish, so that's good. and then i do like the cast that they have in jurassic world. i think they sort of i think they nailed it for sort of that sort of summer block
so that's always great, and all of the jurassic park movies have fantastic visual effects, so it's a big budget movie. but it's big budget for a reason, they really get the feel of the dinosaurs and everything is so much more realistic than you'd think. and it really helps to carry off what they're going for in a movie.
thank you. you give the best critiques! good night.
good night.
what kinds of movies do you like?
i like
action movies a lot. and i do like comedies.
fancy stuff is pretty good sometimes, and i like documentaries, but it depends on the subject.
what draws you to those kinds of movies?
the characters who actors that play the characters. the plot of the movie, what the movie's about. if i'd know if the reviews are good, i'll probably check it out. if it's something i've been wanting to watch since forever, i'll check it out. if it's a continuation of a trilogy, i'll watch it or if it's a continuation of a series, i'll watch the movie like
the fast and the furious
i see. and what kinds of movies do you avoid or dislike?
i usually avoid movies that are badly reviewed that i or that i know that are
aren't my style like what i like to watch for example, i don't like watching horror movies with thrillers. i said that the reviews.
probably movies that i know that are not get entertaining me entertain me for the 1 or 2 and 1/2-hour mark.
okay. and why do you avoid that kind of movie?
i usually avoid something that doesn't entertain me because i don't want to be bored or fall asleep in movies. because if i wanted to fall asleep in movies, i don't want to pay $20 in movie theater or five bucks just to rent a movie and then just fall asleep. if it's like thriller or horror movie, i don't want like to be scared cuz i can get scared easily and get nightmares.
real bad dreams
that's fair. now i'm curious, what's a movie that you've seen recently that you liked?
one i've seen recently.
i watched fast 6 which was the sixth movie in the fast & furious the storm series.
i liked it a lot when i when i watched the first time. and then like years later after i watched it the first time. i watched it recently, it was still pretty good. i still enjoy the movie the movie a lot.
in that same vein, what's a movie you've seen that you disliked?
movie that i seen recently that i disliked
last movie i see that i was dissapointed in was i can't remember.
it was justice league. that's the last movie i've seen that i was disappointed in.
why did you feel disappointed in it?
because
the cgi was bad.
it's it was disappointing cuz cgi was bad. i didn't like the plot or the villain they used at the end. i wish they could have done something smaller then went up
and the cut that was in the theaters wasn't from the original director cuz he stepped out like near before re-shoots.
and so, they had some other director, and they used both directors cuts which was weird.
that's fair. now given what you've said, i'm curious if you have seen or heard of aquaman
i've heard of aquaman. i didn't see it, but i want to because i'm a big jason momoa fan, and i heard it was pretty good, better than anyone expected. and the director james wan did a pretty great job with the way the movie looks.
but, i do plan on seeing it some time soon. probably when when i'm able to rent it or buy it on blu-ray.
i see, thank you. how about deadpool 2?
i love deadpool 2. it's really funny. i lke how the character breaks the fourth wall and it's sort of comic book accurate. so, it was pretty interesting to watch. i didn't say it was better than the first one but it was still fun to see and i had a great time watching it.
do you like when movies are comic book accurate?
yeah, i do. it makes
well, i sort of do. because if it's comic book accurate and you've read the comics, you already know what's going to happen. but when they change a little, i don't mind it. like if they change a character to be a different race or gender, like okay, whatever. but
if it's a big thing where they change the origin story of the superhero then it's something i'll be skeptical about until i see it.
what type of movies do you enjoy?
i really like romance, and comedies, and some dramas as well.
what appeals to you with these type of movies?
i like that they're really cute and i like that they always
i like to see like keep me on the edge of my seat wanting to know who is going to end up with who, and who's going to get married to who or, you know, stuff like that.
is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
i really like how to lose a guy in 10 days and i like let's see how to lose a guy in 10 days, and she's all that, and never been kissed.
what did you like about these movies?
i liked the actors the most, i loved drew barrymore and freddy prinze jr. i am a '90s and early 2000s kid at heart and so i still love watching them they're just funny and sort of wholesome and just something that can you know you can watch over and over again.
are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?
i don't like horror movies. i don't like scary movies or action super hero movies.
what about these movies is unappealing?
i just really don't like being scared. i don't like things creeping up on me, and scaring me. i don't like blood and guts, and i just really don't like fighting. the ring, and any of the avengers movie.
is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?

i don't like the avengers. i don't like all the fighting and violence that's in it.
have you seen crazy rich asians
no, but we are going to watch it this weekend, and i am so excited.
what interests you about this movie?
i love the actress that's on fresh off the boat, the one that play jessica who's in this movie. i don't know what her character's name in the movie is, but i think she's just so adorable.
thank you for your help and have a wonderful day!
what are some type of movies that you like?
i typically like the the sort of sci-fi sort of movies. like for instance, star wars or any any type of like action movies or like some really like aesthetically pleasing movies. for instance, interstellar was a really good movie. inception i also thought was a really good movie. movies with really good music scores are also really good on a are a really good
what did you like about inception?
i really one of the things i liked about it was like the whole like music thing about it, and then like the whole story behind it, as well. like the way if you dream, then you it like there's more layers to your dreams, and then inside the dream, it'll be like like 100 years inside of a dream, but it's like a second in real life.
how did u like the ending?
i thought the ending was pretty cool. it was also like a really big like cliffhanger that i was very surprised with. i was not expecting the whole the top to not fall over, so
it is pretty cool.
ok. can you name me a movie you didn't like?
i don't really think there are many movies that i wasn't too fond of, to be honest. i feel like most movies i thoroughly enjoy, and there aren't really any that i just that i don't really that i'm not fond of.
have you heard of the movie django unchained?
yes, i have. i've also watched that movie before.
what did you like about this kind of movie?
i really like the action and all that like the like i really like like the action in that movie was pretty great. and like they were some parts of it that i don't like typically because i don't really watch r-rated movies but other than like those small parts like they were some like some of the parts were really gory and i was and i wasn't i wasn't worry about them a lot of blood and am like but, i really enjoyed like the i really enjoyed like besides the blood the the whole action thing and everything about it
and then the way it portrayed like the south back in the day.
okay. thank you
what kinds of movies do you like?
i like movies that are more like art house films. one of my favorite movies is the fall. i also like horror movies and just weird movies in general.
well, tell me why do you like art house films?
i like them because usually there's a lot of symbolism and there's a lot of thought that goes into every scene usually things are there for a reason and put there for purpose unlike your typical action film that doesn't really have that.
cool, what was your favorite movie again?
the fall.
alright, why is that your favorite movie
because i love the cinematography. it's beautifully filmed. it was filmed, i think in over 20 countries. it was filmed by a director called tarsem singh, if i say his name right. and i believe he financed most of it. it was sort of his pet project, and i like the story. but it's just beautifully
a particular movie, i can't think off the top of my head, but in general i'm not a huge fan of comedies. well, actually i can think of one. i don't really care for like superbad or movies like that.
interesting, is there a movie you do not like
oh, why not?
i just think they're stupid, they're not that interesting to me, and they bore me. it's not my kind of comedy.
ok, then have you seen the movie the martian
i did see that movie.
what is it about this kind of movies that you like or dislike?
the martian was a little slow, i will have to say. it wasn't terrible or anything. i like sci-fi movies, but it was just slow. it got a little boring in parts. if i was going to pick a sci-fi movie that came out around that same time period, i would've picked interstellar. i think it had a better story and more meaning. and just was more interesting
although, i believe the motion was more to the book and not necessarily i wouldn't say to the book, but to how it would surely be to be stuck up on more by yourself eventually.
wonderful. thank you for sharing. good bye.
goodbye

i like comedy movies
i like biopics. i enjoy watching action movies with adventure. drama movies are something new i'm getting into, also. not so keen in liking horror movies or thrillers, though.

i enjoyed it because action movies, they have a lot of explosions and things going on at once. comedy because i do like to laugh sometimes, even though the jokes are bad. but not as real real bad. biopics, i like to see the life made of whoever they're making the movie about. documentaries are good because you get to know how stuff happened during that time and what was going on with the people

recently or in general?
whatever comes to your mind
i enjoyed watching spider-man: into the spider-verse.
nice. how about movies that you don't like, can you talk about them?
venom
what did you dislike about it?
what i disliked about venom was they made it a pg-13 movie when it should've been rated r. because venom is like the antihero. and he's he should be one that doesn't care about anything. like he he likes to kill, and he likes to do other things. but they toned that down a lot from what everybody was expecting it to be when they first dropped the teaser trailer.

okay that's good to know. what about a particular movie name you liked
the pirate bay afk, that was a good movie.
what did you like about that movie?
i'm big into i'm big into computer culture, and i've certainly done my fair share of pirating back in the day. so, i was pretty well acquainted with the pirate bay. but like even though i knew what it was, and how to use it, etc, i was interested in learning about like how it came to be, what happened to it
i see. thank you. what kind of movies don't you like?
i don't really like chick flicks.
why not?
well, i'm not a chick, so therefore they don't really appeal to me.

could u name a movie that fits that category, and tell me some things you like about that kind of movie

could u also tell me about a movie that fits that category that wasn't good in your opinion, and what make you dislike that kind of movie
i usually like bruce willis as an action star and he made a recent movie called precious cargo which was just bad and not well directed in the acting was just very unbelievable and i really hated it.

is a good balance between action story and an interesting plot and it and it just speaks to me.
i see. so what's a movie you saw that you really didn't like?
dumb and dumber, i think it was the movie name was appropriate. like everybody said it was really funny and, but i didn't really enjoy it.
why?
it didn't make me laugh. it felt like it was forced comedy. you know, like when you're watching a comedy, and and the jokes feel like they're they're not spontaneous.
that makes sense.
okay so i'm curious. have you seen captain marvel?
no, i have not.

i haven't seen that either. but that's one i actually want to see for sure, because that got really good reviews from people. they said they really enjoyed it.
okay how about solo, did you see that?
no, i did not.
why not?
i haven't really looked into newer star wars movies. i i really like the old ones, and i don't feel like any of the new ones can measure up to it, so i'm not really interested in ruining the story, so to speak, that i watched when i was a child and have fond memories of.

i've always felt like cartoons and anime movies are really kind of interesting to watch and relax to.

what did you like about it?
well, even though there was almost there wasn't really hardly any actual dialog the movie kept you interested. it had some very great acting in it, and it kept you on to just see what was going to happen at the end. it wasn't a typical ending.
it was a twist ending?
yes, it was unexpected

because they sing constantly?
yes, and i feel like they're often kind of cheesy.
what kind of movies do you like?
i like war movies.
what do you like about war movies?
i like that they depict an otherwise taboo subject, like i know that hollywood and movies in general are a bit exaggerated and they are not necessary factually correct, but they give people like me who have never seen anything like war a glimpse into what war could or does look like.
i think that's pretty cool.
can you name a particular war movie you like?
saving private ryan is a good one.
i see. can you tell me a movie you did not like?
that's going to be difficult.
i didn't like killer bongs from outer space.
how come you did not like killer bongs from outer space?
well, it was a very very cheesy b you know b list movie or whatever it's called and i mean like, i get that that was kinda the point, but it was just so bad it was it was hard to stomach.
gotcha. did you like wonder woman?
no, i've never watched it.
oh. what about the hangover?
i think i watched it, i don't remember much about it. i don't think i minded it, but i didn't like like it enough to watch the sequels, so it's just kind of meh.
that's alright. the first one was probably the only good one anyways
yeah.
how do you feel about sci fy movies?
it depends how atrocious it was, so i'd say that they are not too bad. i mean, i'm sure that probably some more serious ones might be good.
gotcha. thanks for you input today

daddy's home 2

yes, i have.

i have not seen the movie.
what about the movie the dawn of the planet of apes?
yes. i like that movie.
what did you like about it?
i like how it was a role reversal and how easy humans have it, but it could be a different kind of civilization. it could be apes ruling the humans.
okay. thank you
what type of movies are you interested in?
are there any specific titles that you like in this genre?
oh sure. matrix, alien series, blade runner, those are probably the three classics or my favorite in the genre.
a lot of people do regard these movies as classics, what did you find interesting about them?
well visually they're ground breaking. many movies try to copy them either in style or either in
the vision that they they show of the future. the stories are usually pretty simple, so so you really and it's about like world building, and you get you lose yourself in the time period or the world that they've created.
you enjoy the creativity of them as well as the writing and narrative?
yes, maybe more so than the narrative and the writing. like usually, the narrative or writing is pretty simple, and and they let you just kind of be enveloped by the the art design and the and the setting of the and the world building that they've created.
so you like the feeling of immersion into the worlds they have created?
absolutely, i think that's the main reason that there's they are considered classics is where they do those that that type of world building better than others. plus i think that's why people like science fiction is it's kind of like exploring or and it putting yourselves in a whole different place that you can't access in the real world.
i can see why that is appealing, some people would consider those titles as a blueprint for successful science fiction films
and i think that's true that's why often times the most copied
by other films
are there any specific movie types that you don't like?
movie types, i don't like i guess bad versions of
in a genre like like superhero movies, i like in general, but you know, there's bad ones like suicide squad or spider-man 3, where it just kind of goes off the rails and and kind of you almost they almost make you question if you like those type of movies anymore.
what did you not like particularly about those two films?
just throw them in there at last minute and kind of took away and not to mention the whole stuff with peter parker going dark and the famous scene of him dancing and stuff. it just seems kind of goes too far to being all those early spider-man movies are very campy, but that goes a little bit too far. and then suicide squad is just a mess. it doesn't narratively, character-wise, it just there's
there's like four beginnings i think to that movie where they introduce the characters like three or four different times, and then there's too many characters, and the story's not very good, so it's just not very good.
yes, and it was a good version of the dc movies. movies like suicide squad, they struggle. i think they kind of fall into that spider-man thing where they throw too much at you or into their movies, and the tone is very dark, but wonder woman was not that. it was very kind of felt like a marvel movie a little bit. had a little optimism to it.
thank you for that
mhm.
goodbye
what kind of movies do you like?
i really i guess i like teen movies a lot.
do you have a specific title from this genre that you enjoy?
probably one of my i mean a recent one that i like is the duff. i like that a lot. in terms of like all time, she's the man is one of my favorites. i like 10 things i hate about you, love that.
what makes you enjoy those films ?
so, all those films have great casts. you know, teen films can be hard cos they are obviously casting younger talent, but they actually a lot of the teen firms are like have gone on to be like good actors later on. so, they are they are good choices, they are just younger before they are becoming sort of a bigger superstars. the other things about those are like 10 things i hate about you and she's the man is that those were series of movies that actually were based on shakespeare novels, and so it's actually very clever retelling of the stories that really sort of stretched the bounds of what usually teen movie is, so it make the teen movie a little bit more complex, a little more interesting while still being funny and enjoyable so great combination.
i understand why you enjoy those films. is there any movies you dislike?
oh. plenty. like a film that i hate just in general is le divorce, one of the worst films i've ever seen in my life.
what makes you dislike that film?
it felt like we were fooled. they kind of built this sort of, like, a light-hearted sort of a comedy drama with a good cast and it was anything but. it was, i mean, outside of it just being a complete and utter mess from a story line and writing stand point, despite being based on a book.
it was it honestly had aspects of a thriller in it. it was such a bad movie. and it was so far away from what they acted as if it was going to be going in. it's not even funny. literally one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life.
i understand and i see your view on this film. i see you feel mislead and it was not true to the novel.
no
not at all.
have you seen crazy rich asians?
not yet. i'm looking forward to that one.
what makes you interested in that movie?
it's fantastic that they are doing a big budget, romantic comedy with asian-american leads, it's fantastic. first time it's really ever been done and i love comedies, i love romantic comedies, so it's a good combination and i'm interested in seeing a nice diverse portrayal in the movie. and it just seems and it listen, overall it just seems funny.
the cast is great. i love the woman, the lead woman from her other projects. so, i have nothing but high hopes for that one.
it seems like a lot of people are interested for the same reasons. thank you for that, it was very helpful.
see you later
what kinds of movies do you like?
one of my favorite genres of movies is comedy, i also like action movies.
why do you like comedy movies?
well, its nice to have a good laugh, and it makes me feel good, happy, joyful and care-free.
is there a movie that you like?
one of my favorite comedy movies it might be a little bit childish, but is jim carrey's ace ventura. this was back in the day during the 1990s.
why do you like that movie?
it's just full of slapstick moment goofy moments, and it's and it's jim carrey. he's one of the funniest actors.
how about a movie you did not like?
a movie that i didn't like much it really isn't comedy but i guess it's more of a drama type movie, it was children of men. i i mean it got good ratings and all that, but i didn't i didn't think that it was that good.
why not?
the the story was kind of boring. the the movie didn't flow through well and i just found myself sitting there wondering what's happening or what's going to happen next then and then i didn't understand the movie so much.
well then have you seen forest gump?
yes, i have seen forrest gump.
what is it about these kinds of movies that you like or dislike?
i think forrest gump was was a pretty movie. it was kind of heartwarming, touching, the story about i guess you would say an underdog going through certain phases in life, and coming out to be one of the most recognized people in the us. then at most of the times, he didn't even know what was going on, it seems like. overall
he was sort of like a hero. let's say an unknown well, i wouldn't say unknown, but an accidental hero, i would say.
can you tell me what types of movies you like?
i like comedy movies.
ok, what about comedies do you like?

ok, can you name a specific film you didn't like. it doesn't have to be an anime but it can be if you'd like?

is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
going clear was really good.
what did you like about this movie?
i've never known much about scientology before the movie. and i watched it, and it was just interesting to see all the crazy practices they preach. and the people who left the church talking about it and how much of an evil organization it is. i just felt a lot smarter and more educated about the topic after seeing it.
are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?
not a big fan of comic book movies.
what about these movies is unappealing?
i just don't think the stories are very engaging. like i mean, i know like they obviously aren't true. but it's hard to even suspend disbelief for most of them, just cuz they're so ridiculous that you can't believe them. like batman, i can at least believe. like superman and anything that involves crazy other planets and stuff, i just can't invested in.
is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?
i have, maybe that i didn't like.
dinosaur was terrible, but that's not a comic book movie.
what do you dislike about this movie?
it was the worst disney movie i ever saw. like it didn't even feel like it had a story. i remember it was like 30 minutes in, and i just wanted to walk out of the theater cuz i was so bored. and i was a little kid seeing it. i was like the target demographic.
have you seen supersize me
yep, i've seen that.
what did you enjoy or not enjoy about this movie?
it was a good documentary. it was interesting to see i mean the idea of it just did excite me not exciting, but interesting. someone just going to eat mcdonald's for i think it was 30 days straight and see what happens to their body afterwards. so it was just intriguing to see what actually happens.

not really like a quentin tarantino like from hell or something like that. the it's it's just too much. too much blood, too much gore, these kind of ones that are i mean, i know they're fake, but in order for me to get through it, i have to remind myself it's fake, which sort of defeats the purpose of watching it.

it was okay. the on the plus side, the acting is fantastic, the direction is great, and the imagery is very interesting and innovative. but on the negative side, it's entirely too confusing for its own good, and pretending otherwise is a joke. like the people said they loved it, i asked them questions, and they couldn't explain anything. so i think it was more it was such a it was such a beautiful film to watch.
the direction and all the cinematography and the special effects that i think people don't want to say they don't like it, but it's a confusing movie.

what about these movies is unappealing?
they usually have elements of like gore or horror or like zombie that i'm not crazy about in terms of they scare me usually and i just like to avoid that kind of thing. and then also a lot of them over shoot what they are doing, so they don't sort of break it down into something that turns into a good movie, they make it complicated to even bother enjoying.

the thirteenth floor was not good.
what do you dislike about this movie?
that was a movie that was too complicated for its own good. it was trying to be really interesting and use sort of imagery and different sort of story lines to create this sort of sci-fi world, but it ended up not making sense. it had a good cast, not a great cast, but a good cast, and they could have really tried to do something with it. but the story line really left the cast hanging, and it's just
it's not like it's not like the worst movies, but it's a bad movie because i still after all these years can't tell you what happened in that movie.
have you seen home alone 3?
i have.
what did you enjoy or not enjoy about this movie?
i did not enjoy that movie because home alone the original and home alone 2 star macaulay culkin. the third stars a completely different actor who is not as charismatic as macaulay is, so leaving the movie to just him was a problem. he could not carry off the starring role in the same way, so the first two like almost everybody else, i consider the first two be home alone movies and ignore the rest.
