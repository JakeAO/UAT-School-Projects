Outline strategies for recovery (Defer, Disperse, Relocate)
- Defer: Shipping can be deferred a bit, ideally the company it's operating right up against delivery deadlines anyway so shipping can get a little backed up. Manufacturing can be deferred, depending on the active contracts and their status. IT can't really be deferred too much.
- Disperse: 
- Relocate: Manufacturing is the only department which can't be relocated due to the specialized, custom-made machines being used. All other departments' responsibilities could be relatively easily relocated.

Look at our document and decide what our minimal operation capacity is!
- I don't know what this is, isn't this just the minimum critical business functions below?

Define what the minimum critical business functions are and how long it might take to recover.
- Manufacturing (Disks, Packaging, Inserts) - At minimum recovery takes 2 days (specified in the assignment prompt thing).
- Shipping (Receiving Supplies, Shipping Product) - Recovery should be quick.
- IT (Database Containing Masters, Database Containing Orders) - No idea on recovery time.

Document (3?) example disaster scenarios for recovery with strategy.
- Building Two is destroyed somehow: Sales & Advertising either shut down temporarily, or move to Building One with adminstration. They'll probably need laptops. R&D can shut down temporarily, or move to Building Three. Shipping has to remain open, but will move to Building Three with Manufacturing (which is a better location anyway).
- Building Three is destroyed somehow: Big screwed. Need to order new servers and hopefully IT has backups to put on them. Need to order new custom manufacturing machines, which is going to take a long, long time.

Plan for 3 months (90) days

What does our testing look like. Are we practicing a plan with drills?
- ?

GAP ANAYLISIS THE DOCUMENT looking for suprises in the plan. What are we missing in the plan that we have not thought of yet?
- Need plan activation procedures outlined for BC/DR and IR.
- Need mitigation procedures outlined for BC/DR.
- Need IR response plans.
